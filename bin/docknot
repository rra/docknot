=head1 NAME

docknot - Generate human-readable documentation from package metadata

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<docknot> B<-h>

B<docknot> generate [B<-m> I<metadata>] [B<-w> I<width>] I<template> [I<output>]

B<docknot> generate-all [B<-m> I<metadata>] [B<-w> I<width>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<docknot> can perform various actions related to documenting or releasing
software packages, organized into subcommands.  The supported subcommands are:

=over 4

=item generate

Use metadata files and templates to generate human-readable documentation
files for a package.  See L<App::DocKnot::Generate> for documentation on the
metadata format, configuration files, and paths.

=item generate-all

Like C<generate>, but generates all of the package documentation for which
default output files are configured.  This is a quick short-cut to generating
all documentation that's shipped with the package.

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

Each B<docknot> subcommand takes its own options.

=head2 Global Options

=over 4

=item B<-h>, B<--help>

Print out usage information and exit.

=back

=head2 generate

=over 4

=item B<-m> I<metadata>, B<--metadata>=I<metadata>

The path to the metadata files for the package whose documentation is being
generated.  This should be a directory containing all the package metadata
files required by App::DocKnot.  Default: F<docs/metadata> relative to the
current directory (which is the recommended metadata path for a project).

=item B<-w> I<width>, B<--width>=I<width>

Column width at which the generated output is wrapped.  Default: 74.

=item I<template>

The template to use when generating the output file.

=item I<output>

The path to the output file to generate.  If this argument isn't given, the
output file will be chosen based on the template as follows:

    readme     ->  README
    readme-md  ->  README.md

If the template isn't listed above, this argument is required.

=back

=head2 generate-all

=over 4

=item B<-m> I<metadata>, B<--metadata>=I<metadata>

The path to the metadata files for the package whose documentation is being
generated.  This should be a directory containing all the package metadata
files required by App::DocKnot.  Default: F<docs/metadata> relative to the
current directory (which is the recommended metadata path for a project).

=item B<-w> I<width>, B<--width>=I<width>

Column width at which the generated output is wrapped.  Default: 74.

=back

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

If B<docknot> fails with errors, see the underlying module for that subcommand
for information about what those errors might mean.  Internally, it can also
produce the following diagnostics:

=over 4

=item cannot write to %s: %s

(F) The output file specified with B<-o> could not be written to.

=item missing required option %s

(F) One of the required command-line options was not given.

=item no subcommand given

(F) No subcommand was given after B<docknot> on the command line.

=item unknown command %s

(F) The given subcommand was not recognized.

=back

In addition, other L<Getopt::Long> error messages may result from invalid
command-line options.
