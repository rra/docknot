                       User-Visible DocKnot Changes

DocKnot 4.01 (unreleased)

    DocKnot now supports a global configuration file.  The default
    location is $HOME/.config/docknot/config.yaml, but it honors the XDG
    environment variables.  Currently, this configuration file can be used
    to set the distribution directory and signing PGP key for docknot
    dist.

    docknot dist can now optionally sign distribution tarballs with GnuPG
    after they have been generated.  To request signing, use the --pgp-key
    command-line option or set pgp_key in the new global configuration
    file.

    The -d option to docknot dist is now optional if distdir is set in
    DocKnot's global configuration file.

    Remove the load_appdata_json helper function from App::DocKnot.  This
    is no longer used now that all DocKnot data is in YAML.

    Properly import Pod::Usage so that docknot --help works.

    Correct the REQUIREMENTS sections of the module documentation to
    reflect new dependencies and the removal of a JSON dependency from
    most of DocKnot.

    Fix left-over documentation references to the old metatada path.

DocKnot 4.00 (2020-12-25)

    Change the metadata format to a single YAML file, with a slightly
    different internal representation, whose default location is
    docs/docknot.yaml.  The new docknot update command (or the
    App::DocKnot::Update module) will convert from the old JSON format.
    The new metadata format is checked against a schema when read.
    DocKnot now depends on YAML::XS and Kwalify.

    Support a test.override metadata key that overrides the Testing
    section in README and README.md files entirely, except for the note
    about Lancaster Consensus environment variables.

    Move bootstrap metadata to build.bootstrap, build.lancaster to
    test.lancaster, packaging to distribution.packaging, packaging.debian
    to distribution.packaging.debian.package, debian to
    distribution.packaging.debian, and readme.sections to sections to
    clean up some old issues with the schema now that there's an upgrade
    process.  If readme.sections defined a testing section, move that to
    test.override.

    Drop support for the support.cpan metadata key, since the CPAN RT
    instance is going away.  For packages with support.cpan set, if
    vcs.github was set and support.github was not, set support.github to
    match vcs.github during a docknot update.

    Drop the current version number from the title of README.md.  This is
    not a common practice and doesn't seem to add much value.

    Word wrap numeric lists and, in Markdown output, quoted paragraphs.
    Previously these preserved the original spacing from the input text
    snippets.

    Require paragraphs be indented by at least six spaces, not five, to be
    treated as verbatim paragraphs and left unwrapped.  (Markdown
    paragraphs can still use four spaces because they are wrapped in
    markup lines.)

    Add some additional markup to the Markdown version of building
    instructions for packages that use Kerberos and Autoconf.

    Use https for the link and badge for unmaintained packages.

DocKnot 3.05 (2020-08-09)

    Change the heuristic for when to refrain from wrapping output
    paragraphs to require they start with three short lines rather than
    two, ignore the indentation, and increase the threshold for a short
    line to 45 characters from 40.

    Force the badge for the Debian version in README.md to point to
    unstable rather than stable.

    Depend on JSON::MaybeXS instead of JSON, and List::SomeUtils instead
    of List::MoreUtils.

    Update to rra-c-util 8.3:

    * Fix style issues caught by Perl::Critic::Freenode.
    * Ignore debian/changelog when checking for obsolete strings.

DocKnot 3.04 (2020-05-16)

    Change the vcs.travis metadata key to vcs.status.travis.  This will
    require changes to all templates and package metadata.json files that
    use this key.

    Add support for generating a build status badge from a GitHub Actions
    workflow.  To do this, set vcs.status.workflow to the name of the
    workflow that should be referenced for the badge.

    Also specify DocKnot's dependencies with a cpanfile.  This makes it
    easier to install its dependencies with some tools, such as cpm.

DocKnot 3.03 (2020-01-19)

    For CPAN packages pushed to GitHub, add a Shields.io license badge to
    the Markdown README file.

    For packages with a Debian package, add a Shields.io badge for the
    version in Debian.

    docknot dist now uses IO::Uncompress::Gunzip and IO::Compress::Xz to
    generate a missing xz tarball rather than running external gzip and xz
    programs, which avoids test failures when those programs aren't
    available or don't support the expected options.  Thanks to Slaven
    ReziÄ‡ for the testing and report.  (#131406)

    docknot dist now supports a distribution/ignore metadata setting,
    which contains a list of regular expressions of files to ignore when
    checking a distribution tarball for completeness.

    Stop leaking exceptions via $@ to the caller of App::DocKnot::Config.
    Configuration parsing catches and ignores a variety of errors, which
    previously were polluting the caller's $@.

DocKnot 3.02 (2020-01-08)

    Add support for the No Maintenance Intended badge in the Markdown
    README file if the package is marked as orphaned.

    If the native distribution generation commands create only a
    gzip-compressed tarball, generate an xz-compressed tarball from the
    gzip-compressed tarball during docknot dist.

    docknot dist now checks for files present in the source tree but
    missing from the distribution, apart from a (currently hard-coded)
    list of exceptions.

    docknot dist now removes any existing directory when creating a new
    distribution.  It overrides permissions if possible while doing this
    so that it can clean up from a failed Automake make distcheck, so the
    destination directory should be trusted, not one to which an attacker
    may be able to write files.

    Remove make warnings from the commands when building a distribution
    that supports C++ with the C++ compiler, since my current Autoconf
    warning flag discovery code doesn't properly exclude options that are
    unsupported by C++.

    Properly skip a test on Windows that requires tar.

DocKnot 3.01 (2019-07-14)

    docknot dist now also runs make check-cppcheck for Autoconf build
    systems.

    If the valgrind key is set to true in the package build metadata,
    docknot dist now also runs make check-valgrind for Autoconf build
    systems.

    Allow the path to Perl to be configured in App::DocKnot::Dist.  This
    is used primarily for testing so that we can try building a
    distribution using Module::Build with the same Perl used to run the
    test suite.  This is exposed by the module API but (intentionally) not
    exposed on the docknot command line.  Thanks, Slaven Rezic.  (#129958)

    Set user.name and user.email for Git in dist/basic.t test.

    Hopefully fix tests on Windows via more correct use of File::Temp
    objects: be clear about using the file name instead of the file
    descriptor, and delete the file by letting the File::Temp object go
    out of scope.

DocKnot 3.00 (2019-06-29)

    Separate configuration parsing into a new App::DocKnot::Config module,
    used by App::DocKnot::Generate.

    Move the entry point for command-line commands from App::DocKnot to
    App::DocKnot::Command.  The App::DocKnot module now only provides some
    helper methods to load application data, used by both
    App::DocKnot::Config and App::DocKnot::Generate.  It's no longer
    necessary to explicitly load App::DocKnot before using one of the
    submodules.

    Add new docknot dist command and App::DocKnot::Dist module, which runs
    appropriate commands to create a distribution tarball.  This command
    will also run the test suite, with both Clang and GCC for packages
    using Autoconf, and will also build and test with C++ if the package
    indicates that it supports C++ via the build.cplusplus key in the
    package metadata.

    Support orphaned warnings in the README and README.md output as well
    as thread output.

    Add bug tracker links pointing to the CPAN RT installation to the
    developer documentation links section of the thread template if
    support.cpan is set.

    Output more helpful information about test failures on Windows and
    other systems that don't have the diff command.

DocKnot 2.00 (2019-01-12)

    Move previous docknot command functionality to a new docknot generate
    subcommand.  All docknot actions in the future will be added as
    subcommands.

    docknot generate now takes the name of the template as its first
    positional argument instead of as the -t option.

    generate() and therefore the generate subcommand now defaults to
    looking for metadata in docs/metadata, and the -m option is now
    optional.

    The -o option to docknot generate and the output argument to
    generate_output() is now optional if there is a default output file
    defined for the template.  The two defaults are README for the readme
    template and README.md for the readme-md template, both in the current
    directory.

    Rename App::DocKnot to App:DocKnot::Generate and add a new
    generate_output() method that writes the generated output to a
    specified file instead of returning it as a string.  App::DocKnot must
    be loaded as well to use the module API.

    Add new generate-all command and generate_all() method that generates
    all package documentation files with a default output file.

    Separate the TESTING section from BUILD AND INSTALLATION for Perl
    modules in both README and README.md, and move the Lancaster
    instructions to that section.  Add instructions for how to run a
    single test with Perl build systems.  Test dependencies for Perl
    modules should now move into docs/metadata/test/suffix, the same as
    for packages with an Autoconf build system.

    If build.lancaster is set to true, add the standard section on
    Lancaster consensus variables to the end of a TESTING section in
    README and README.md even when a custom testing section is provided in
    the metadata.

    Update to rra-c-util 8.0:

    * Fix t/style/strict.t to skip blib and .git directories.
    * Update style for the latest perltidy.

DocKnot 1.06 (2018-08-31)

    When generating text output, put the footnotes containing URLs for
    links immediately following the containing paragraph rather than the
    end of the text block.  This is both more readable and avoids odd
    placement of the footnotes when a template adds further paragraphs to
    the end of a text block containing footnotes.

    Do not wrap paragraphs in output that seem to be a bunch of short
    lines, and add support for broken quotes (multiple short lines, such
    as poetry) in quotes in the thread template.

    Adjust the README and README.md template to say that make warnings
    requires either GCC or Clang, instead of only mentioning GCC.

    Adjust the README.md wording for the list information URL when package
    releases are announced on a mailing list.

    Add support for additional developer documentation links in the thread
    output template.

    Add support for contributed program documentation links in the thread
    output template.

DocKnot 1.05 (2018-05-05)

    Add the Travis-CI badge to README.md and a link to Travis-CI to the
    thread development links if the vcs.travis key is set in
    metadata.json.

    Add a Shields.io badge for the CPAN version to README.md and a link to
    metacpan.org in the thread output if the distribution.cpan key is set
    in metadata.json.

    Move the description of Lancaster Consensus environment variables into
    the testing section of README and README.md instead of the
    requirements section, since they're more about running the tests and
    less about package requirements in general.

    Add support for a new packaging/extra metadata file (setting the
    packaging.extra key in templates) and use it in the thread template.

    Correctly handle multi-paragraph debian.summary metadata in the thread
    template.

    Fix formatting bug in the README template when additional bootstrap
    documentation is provided.

    DocKnot now requires Perl 5.24 or later.

DocKnot 1.04 (2018-03-24)

    Fix SPDX test failure on Windows.

DocKnot 1.03 (2018-03-17)

    Add support for a new metadata file, support/extra, that includes
    information that should be added into the middle of the normal SUPPORT
    section of README and README.md files.

    Add a paragraph to the license section of README and README.md saying
    that SPDX license identifiers are in use and providing a pointer to
    the SPDX license list.

    Add SPDX-License-Identifier headers to all substantial source files,
    and add a test to check for them.

DocKnot 1.02 (2017-12-31)

    Support quoted paragraphs (each line starting with ">") and turn them
    into indentation when turning markup into plain text.

    Support numbered lists when converting to thread.

    Force long, unbreakable lines to be left intact when wrapping.

    When wrapping paragraphs, preserve two spaces after periods even when
    the period comes before a closing parenthesis or quote mark.

    Support test/prefix metadata, which replaces the introduction to the
    test instructions.

    Add new license text BSD-3-clause-or-GPL-1+ to support pam-krb5.
    Support markdown formatting in license texts when converting to
    thread to handle the numbered clauses.

    Support more complex quote attributions in thread output, and
    automatically add \cite[] around work names if they don't contain
    double quotes.

    Add security advisory support to the thread template.

DocKnot 1.01 (2016-12-25)

    Add build and test instructions for Autoconf packages, including
    details about Kerberos configuration, to the README and README.md
    templates.  Allow a testing section in the metadata to override the
    added testing section.  Add a flag to indicate that the package is not
    intended to be installed, which suppresses some of the template.

    Add support for license notices (the notices metadata file), which
    should be appended to the end of the stock license statement wherever
    it is generated.

    Add support for stock building and installation sections for Perl
    module packages using either Module::Build or ExtUtils::MakeMaker.

    Add thread template support for annotating quotes shorter than 80
    characters with the "short" class.

    Add support for additional bootstrapping requirements in a separate
    bootstrap metadata file, appended to the Autotools bootstrapping
    section (at least for right now).

    Allow markup in the license notices section.

DocKnot 1.00 (2016-10-26)

    Initial public release.  Supports generating text and Markdown README
    files and a thread index page.  There is some automation of the
    requirements section, but only automation for the build and test
    section for Module::Build Perl modules.
