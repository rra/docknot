DocKnot 1.01 (unreleased)

    Add support for license notices (the notices metadata file), which
    should be appended to the end of the stock license statement wherever
    it is generated.

    Add support for stock building and installation sections for Perl
    module packages using either Module::Build or ExtUtils::MakeMaker.

DocKnot 1.00 (2016-10-26)

    Initial public release.  Supports generating text and Markdown README
    files and a thread index page.  There is some automation of the
    requirements section, but only automation for the build and test
    section for Module::Build Perl modules.
