                       User-Visible DocKnot Changes

DocKnot 2.00 (2019-01-12)

    Move previous docknot command functionality to a new docknot generate
    subcommand.  All docknot actions in the future will be added as
    subcommands.

    docknot generate now takes the name of the template as its first
    positional argument instead of as the -t option.

    generate() and therefore the generate subcommand now defaults to
    looking for metadata in docs/metadata, and the -m option is now
    optional.

    The -o option to docknot generate and the output argument to
    generate_output() is now optional if there is a default output file
    defined for the template.  The two defaults are README for the readme
    template and README.md for the readme-md template, both in the current
    directory.

    Rename App::DocKnot to App:DocKnot::Generate and add a new
    generate_output() method that writes the generated output to a
    specified file instead of returning it as a string.  App::DocKnot must
    be loaded as well to use the module API.

    Add new generate-all command and generate_all() method that generates
    all package documentation files with a default output file.

    Separate the TESTING section from BUILD AND INSTALLATION for Perl
    modules in both README and README.md, and move the Lancaster
    instructions to that section.  Add instructions for how to run a
    single test with Perl build systems.  Test dependencies for Perl
    modules should now move into docs/metadata/test/suffix, the same as
    for packages with an Autoconf build system.

    If build.lancaster is set to true, add the standard section on
    Lancaster consensus variables to the end of a TESTING section in
    README and README.md even when a custom testing section is provided in
    the metadata.

    Update to rra-c-util 8.0:

    * Fix t/style/strict.t to skip blib and .git directories.
    * Update style for the latest perltidy.

DocKnot 1.06 (2018-08-31)

    When generating text output, put the footnotes containing URLs for
    links immediately following the containing paragraph rather than the
    end of the text block.  This is both more readable and avoids odd
    placement of the footnotes when a template adds further paragraphs to
    the end of a text block containing footnotes.

    Do not wrap paragraphs in output that seem to be a bunch of short
    lines, and add support for broken quotes (multiple short lines, such
    as poetry) in quotes in the thread template.

    Adjust the README and README.md template to say that make warnings
    requires either GCC or Clang, instead of only mentioning GCC.

    Adjust the README.md wording for the list information URL when package
    releases are announced on a mailing list.

    Add support for additional developer documentation links in the thread
    output template.

    Add support for contributed program documentation links in the thread
    output template.

DocKnot 1.05 (2018-05-05)

    Add the Travis-CI badge to README.md and a link to Travis-CI to the
    thread development links if the vcs.travis key is set in
    metadata.json.

    Add a Shields.io badge for the CPAN version to README.md and a link to
    metacpan.org in the thread output if the distribution.cpan key is set
    in metadata.json.

    Move the description of Lancaster Consensus environment variables into
    the testing section of README and README.md instead of the
    requirements section, since they're more about running the tests and
    less about package requirements in general.

    Add support for a new packaging/extra metadata file (setting the
    packaging.extra key in templates) and use it in the thread template.

    Correctly handle multi-paragraph debian.summary metadata in the thread
    template.

    Fix formatting bug in the README template when additional bootstrap
    documentation is provided.

    DocKnot now requires Perl 5.24 or later.

DocKnot 1.04 (2018-03-24)

    Fix SPDX test failure on Windows.

DocKnot 1.03 (2018-03-17)

    Add support for a new metadata file, support/extra, that includes
    information that should be added into the middle of the normal SUPPORT
    section of README and README.md files.

    Add a paragraph to the license section of README and README.md saying
    that SPDX license identifiers are in use and providing a pointer to
    the SPDX license list.

    Add SPDX-License-Identifier headers to all substantial source files,
    and add a test to check for them.

DocKnot 1.02 (2017-12-31)

    Support quoted paragraphs (each line starting with ">") and turn them
    into indentation when turning markup into plain text.

    Support numbered lists when converting to thread.

    Force long, unbreakable lines to be left intact when wrapping.

    When wrapping paragraphs, preserve two spaces after periods even when
    the period comes before a closing parenthesis or quote mark.

    Support test/prefix metadata, which replaces the introduction to the
    test instructions.

    Add new license text BSD-3-clause-or-GPL-1+ to support pam-krb5.
    Support markdown formatting in license texts when converting to
    thread to handle the numbered clauses.

    Support more complex quote attributions in thread output, and
    automatically add \cite[] around work names if they don't contain
    double quotes.

    Add security advisory support to the thread template.

DocKnot 1.01 (2016-12-25)

    Add build and test instructions for Autoconf packages, including
    details about Kerberos configuration, to the README and README.md
    templates.  Allow a testing section in the metadata to override the
    added testing section.  Add a flag to indicate that the package is not
    intended to be installed, which suppresses some of the template.

    Add support for license notices (the notices metadata file), which
    should be appended to the end of the stock license statement wherever
    it is generated.

    Add support for stock building and installation sections for Perl
    module packages using either Module::Build or ExtUtils::MakeMaker.

    Add thread template support for annotating quotes shorter than 80
    characters with the "short" class.

    Add support for additional bootstrapping requirements in a separate
    bootstrap metadata file, appended to the Autotools bootstrapping
    section (at least for right now).

    Allow markup in the license notices section.

DocKnot 1.00 (2016-10-26)

    Initial public release.  Supports generating text and Markdown README
    files and a thread index page.  There is some automation of the
    requirements section, but only automation for the build and test
    section for Module::Build Perl modules.
