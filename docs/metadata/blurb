DocKnot is a system for generating consistent human-readable software
package documentation from metadata files and templates.  The metadata is
primarily JSON files, but can include files of documentation snippets.
The goal is to generate both web pages and distributed documentation files
(such as `README`) from the same source, using templates for consistency
across multiple packages.
