Capture::Tiny and File::Copy::Recursive are required to run the test
suite.  The following additional Perl modules will be used by the test
suite if present:

* Devel::Cover
* Perl::Critic::Freenode
* Test::MinimumVersion
* Test::Perl::Critic
* Test::Pod
* Test::Pod::Coverage
* Test::Spelling
* Test::Strict
* Test::Synopsis

All are available on CPAN.  Those tests will be skipped if the modules are
not available.
