Perl 5.18 or later and Module::Build are required to build this module.
The following additional Perl modules are required to use it:

    JSON
    File::BaseDir
    File::ShareDir
    JSON
    Perl6::Slurp
    Template (part of Template Toolkit)

The following additional Perl modules will be used by the test suite if
present:

    Test::MinimumVersion
    Test::Perl::Critic
    Test::Pod
    Test::Pod::Coverage
    Test::Spelling
    Test::Strict
    Test::Synopsis

All are available on CPAN.  Those tests will be skipped if the modules are
not available.

To enable tests that don't detect functionality problems but are used to
sanity-check the release, set the environment variable RELEASE_TESTING to
a true value.  To enable tests that may be sensitive to the local
environment or that produce a lot of false positives without uncovering
many problems, set the environment variable AUTHOR_TESTING to a true
value.
