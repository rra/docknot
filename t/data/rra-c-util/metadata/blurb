rra-c-util is my collection of portability functions, utility functions,
Autoconf macros, and related shared C infrastructure, akin to gnulib but
without any GPL-covered code and additional support for Kerberos and PAM
development.  It serves as a common repository of code and infrastructure
used across multiple projects so that files have a canonical latest
version.  It's not intended for installation as a regular package;
instead, other packages are expected to copy files from here as needed.
