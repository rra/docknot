You can build rra-c-util with:

```
    ./configure
    make
```

Pass `--enable-kafs` to configure to attempt to build kafs support, which
will use either an existing libkafs or libkopenafs library or build the
kafs replacement included in this package.  You can also add
`--without-libkafs` to force the use of the internal kafs replacement.

Pass `--enable-silent-rules` to configure for a quieter build (similar to
the Linux kernel).  Use `make warnings` instead of make to build with full
GCC compiler warnings (requires a relatively current version of GCC).

Normally, configure will use `krb5-config` to determine the flags to use
to compile with your Kerberos libraries.  If `krb5-config` isn't found, it
will look for the standard Kerberos libraries in locations already
searched by your compiler.  If the the `krb5-config` script first in your
path is not the one corresponding to the Kerberos libraries you want to
use or if your Kerberos libraries and includes aren't in a location
searched by default by your compiler, you need to specify a different
Kerberos installation root via `--with-krb5=PATH`.  For example:

```
    ./configure --with-krb5=/usr/pubsw
```

You can also individually set the paths to the include directory and the
library directory with `--with-krb5-include` and `--with-krb5-lib`.  You
may need to do this if Autoconf can't figure out whether to use `lib`,
`lib32`, or `lib64` on your platform.

To specify a particular `krb5-config` script to use, either set the
`PATH_KRB5_CONFIG` environment variable or pass it to configure like:

```
    ./configure PATH_KRB5_CONFIG=/path/to/krb5-config
```

To not use `krb5-config` and force library probing even if there is a
`krb5-config` script on your path, set `PATH_KRB5_CONFIG` to a nonexistent
path:

```
    ./configure PATH_KRB5_CONFIG=/nonexistent
```

`krb5-config` is not used and library probing is always done if either
`--with-krb5-include` or `--with-krb5-lib` are given.

GSS-API libraries are found the same way: with `krb5-config` by default if
it is found, and a `--with-gssapi=PATH` flag to specify the installation
root.  `PATH_KRB5_CONFIG` is similarly used to find krb5-config for the
GSS-API libraries, and `--with-gssapi-include` and `--with-gssapi-lib` can
be used to specify the exact paths, overriding any `krb5-config` results.
