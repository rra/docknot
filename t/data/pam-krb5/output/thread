\h2[Blurb]

pam-krb5 is a Kerberos PAM module for either MIT Kerberos or Heimdal.  It
supports ticket refreshing by screen savers, configurable authorization
handling, authentication of non-local accounts for network services,
password changing, and password expiration, as well as all the standard
expected PAM features.  It works correctly with OpenSSH, even with
ChallengeResponseAuthentication and PrivilegeSeparation enabled, and
supports extensive configuration either by PAM options or in krb5.conf or
both.  PKINIT is supported with recent versions of both MIT Kerberos and
Heimdal and FAST is supported with recent MIT Kerberos.

\h2[Description]

pam-krb5 provides a Kerberos PAM module that supports authentication, user
ticket cache handling, simple authorization (via .k5login or checking
Kerberos principals against local usernames), and password changing.  It
can be configured through either options in the PAM configuration itself
or through entries in the system krb5.conf file, and it tries to work
around PAM implementation flaws in commonly-used PAM-enabled applications
such as OpenSSH and xdm.  It supports both PKINIT and FAST to the extent
that the underlying Kerberos libraries support these features.

This is not the Kerberos PAM module maintained on Sourceforge and used on
Red Hat systems.  It is an independent implementation that, if it ever
shared any common code, diverged long ago.  It supports some features that
the Sourceforge module does not (particularly around authorization), and
does not support some options (particularly ones not directly related to
Kerberos) that it does.  This module will never support Kerberos v4 or
AFS.  For an AFS session module that works with this module (or any other
Kerberos PAM module), see
\link[https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/pam-afs-session/][pam-afs-session].

If there are other options besides AFS and Kerberos v4 support from the
Sourceforge PAM module that you're missing in this module, please let me
know.

\h2[Requirements]

Either MIT Kerberos (or Kerberos implementations based on it) or Heimdal
are supported.  MIT Keberos 1.3 or later may be required; this module has
not been tested with earlier versions.

For PKINIT support, Heimdal 0.8rc1 or later or MIT Kerberos 1.6.3 or later
are required.  Earlier MIT Kerberos 1.6 releases have a bug in their
handling of PKINIT options.

For FAST (Flexible Authentication Secure Tunneling) support, MIT Kerberos
1.7 or higher is required.  For anonymous FAST support, anonymous
authentication (generally anonymous PKINIT) support is required in both
the Kerberos libraries and in the local KDC.

This module should work on Linux and Solaris (and build with gcc, clang,
or the Sun C compiler), but has been far more heavily tested on Linux.
There is beta-quality support for the AIX NAS Kerberos implementation.
Other PAM implementations will probably require some porting, although
untested build system support is present for FreeBSD, Mac OS X, and HP-UX.
I personally can only test on Linux and rely on others to report problems
on other operating systems.

Old versions of OpenSSH are known to call \code[pam_authenticate] followed
by \code[pam_setcred(PAM_REINITIALIZE_CRED)] without first calling
\code[pam_open_session], thereby requesting that an existing ticket cache
be renewed (similar to what a screensaver would want) rather than
requesting a new ticket cache be created.  Since this behavior is
indistinguishable at the PAM level from a screensaver, pam-krb5 when used
with these old versions of OpenSSH will refresh the ticket cache of the
OpenSSH daemon rather than setting up a new ticket cache for the user.
The resulting ticket cache will have the correct permissions (this is not
a security concern), but will not be named correctly or referenced in the
user's environment and will be overwritten by the next user login.  The
best solution to this problem is to upgrade OpenSSH.  I'm not sure exactly
when this problem was fixed, but at the very least OpenSSH 4.3 and later
do not exhibit it.

To bootstrap from a Git checkout, or if you change the Automake files and
need to regenerate Makefile.in, you will need Automake 1.11 or later.  For
bootstrap or if you change configure.ac or any of the m4 files it includes
and need to regenerate configure or config.h.in, you will need Autoconf
2.64 or later.  Perl is also required to generate manual pages from a
fresh Git checkout.

An \link[https://archives.eyrie.org/software/ARCHIVE/pam-krb5/] [archive
of older releases] is also available.  \class(alert)[Versions older than
3.13 have known security vulnerabilities and should not be used.]

Debian packages are available from Debian in Debian 4.0 (etch) and later
releases as libpam-krb5 and libpam-heimdal.  The former packages are built
against the MIT Kerberos libraries and the latter against the Heimdal
libraries.  See the
\link[https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/libpam-krb5][Debian package tracker]
for more information.

pam-krb5 is maintained using the Git version control system.  To check out
