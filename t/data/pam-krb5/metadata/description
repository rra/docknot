pam-krb5 provides a Kerberos PAM module that supports authentication, user
ticket cache handling, simple authorization (via .k5login or checking
Kerberos principals against local usernames), and password changing.  It
can be configured through either options in the PAM configuration itself
or through entries in the system krb5.conf file, and it tries to work
around PAM implementation flaws in commonly-used PAM-enabled applications
such as OpenSSH and xdm.  It supports both PKINIT and FAST to the extent
that the underlying Kerberos libraries support these features.

This is not the Kerberos PAM module maintained on Sourceforge and used on
Red Hat systems.  It is an independent implementation that, if it ever
shared any common code, diverged long ago.  It supports some features that
the Sourceforge module does not (particularly around authorization), and
does not support some options (particularly ones not directly related to
Kerberos) that it does.  This module will never support Kerberos v4 or
AFS.  For an AFS session module that works with this module (or any other
Kerberos PAM module), see
[pam-afs-session](https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/pam-afs-session/).

If there are other options besides AFS and Kerberos v4 support from the
Sourceforge PAM module that you're missing in this module, please let me
know.
