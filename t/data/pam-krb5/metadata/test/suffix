The default libkadm5clnt library on the system must match the
implementation of your KDC for the module/expired test to work, since the
two kadmin protocols are not compatible.  If you use the MIT library
against a Heimdal server, the test will be skipped; if you use the Heimdal
library against an MIT server, the test suite may hang.

Several `module/expired` tests are expected to fail with Heimdal 1.5 due
to a bug in Heimdal with reauthenticating immediately after a
library-mediated password change of an expired password.  This is fixed in
later releases of Heimdal.
