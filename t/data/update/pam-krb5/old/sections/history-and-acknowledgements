The module was then patched for the FreeBSD ports collection with
additional modifications by unknown maintainers and then was modified by
Joel Kociolek <joko@logidee.com> to be usable with Debian GNU/Linux.

It was packaged by Sam Hartman as the Kerberos v5 PAM module for Debian
and improved and modified by him and later by Russ Allbery to fix bugs and
add additional features.  It was then adopted by Andres Salomon, who added
support for refreshing credentials.

The current distribution is maintained by Russ Allbery, who also added
support for reading configuration from `krb5.conf`, added many features
for compatibility with the Sourceforge module, commented and standardized
the formatting of the code, and overhauled the documentation.

Thanks to Douglas E. Engert for the initial implementation of PKINIT
support.  I have since modified and reworked it extensively, so any bugs
or compilation problems are my fault.

Thanks to Markus Moeller for lots of debugging and multiple patches and
suggestions for improved portability.

Thanks to Booker Bense for the implementation of the `alt_auth_map`
option.

Thanks to Sam Hartman for the FAST support implementation.
