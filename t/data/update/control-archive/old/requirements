Perl 5.6 or later plus the following additional Perl modules are required:

* Compress::Zlib (included in Perl 5.10 and later)
* Date::Parse (part of TimeDate)
* Net::NNTP (included in Perl 5.8 and later)
* Text::Template

[gzip](https://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/) and
[bzip2](http://www.bzip.org/) are required.  Both are generally available
with current operating systems, possibly as supplemental packages.

process-control expects to be fed file names and message IDs of control
messages on standard input and therefore needs to be run from a news
server or some other source of control messages.  A minimalist news server
like tinyleaf is suitable for this (I wrote tinyleaf, available as part of
[INN](https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/inn/), for this purpose).
