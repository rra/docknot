This software generates an INN control.ctl configuration file from
hierarchy configuration fragments, verifies control messages using GnuPG
where possible, processes new control messages to update a newsgroup list,
archives new control messages, and exports the list of newsgroups in a
format suitable for synchronizing the newsgroup list of a Netnews news
server.  It is the software that maintains the control message and
newsgroup lists available from ftp.isc.org.
