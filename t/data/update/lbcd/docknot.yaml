blurb: |
  lbcd is a daemon that runs on a UNIX system and answers UDP queries with
  information about system load, number of logged-on users, uptime, and free
  /tmp space.  This information can be used to accumulate system status
  across a cluster with light-weight queries or can be used as input to a
  load-balancing system to choose the best system to which to direct new
  incoming connections.
build:
  autoconf: '2.64'
  automake: '1.11'
  autotools: true

    lbcd looks for `$sysconfdir/nolbcd` and returns the maximum load if that
    file is present, allowing one to effectively drop a system out of a
    load-balanced pool by touching that file.  By default, the path is
    `/usr/local/etc/nolbcd`, but you may want to pass `--sysconfdir=/etc` to
    configure to use `/etc/nolbcd`.

    lbcdclient is written in Perl, so you may have to edit the first line of
    the script to point to the correct Perl location on your system.  It does
    not use any sophisticated Perl features or add-on modules.

    You will generally want to start lbcd at system boot.  All that is needed
    is a simple init script to start lbcd with the appropriate options or kill
    it again.  It writes its PID into `/var/run/lbcd.pid` by default (and this
    can be changed with the `-P` option).  On many systems, lbcd will need to
    run as root or as a member of particular groups to obtain system load
    average and uptime information.

description: |
  lbcd provides a lightweight way to query a system via unauthenticated UDP
  for system load information plus some related information that may be
  relevant to determining which system to hand out.  It was designed for use
  with the [lbnamed DNS load
  balancer](https://www.stanford.edu/~riepel/lbnamed/).  System load, number
  of logged-in users, free /tmp space, and system uptime are always
  returned.  lbcd can also be configured to probe various local services and
  modify the returned weights based on whether those services are reachable,
  or to return a static weight for round-robin load balancing.

  The information provided isn't particularly sophisticated, and a good
  hardware load balancer will be able to consider such things as connection
  latency and responsiveness to make better decisions.  However, lbcd with
  lbnamed works quite well for smaller scale problems, scales well to
  multiple load balance pools for different services, provides a simple UDP
  health check service, and is much simpler and cheaper to understand and
  deploy.

  Included in this package is a small client program, lbcdclient, which can
  query an lbcd server and display a formatted version of the returned
  information.

  It was originally written by Roland Schemers.  Larry Schwimmer rewrote it
  to add protocol version 3 with some additional features and service
  probing, and then I rewrote it again to update the coding style and use my
  standard portability layer.

  Although I believe it is still useful, I no longer use this method of DNS
  load balancing and am no longer maintaining this package.  If you would
  like to pick up maintenance of it, please feel free.  Contact me if you
  would like this page to redirect to its new home.
requirements: |
  lbcd is written in C, so you'll need a C compiler.  It also uses kernel
  calls to obtain load and uptime information, and at present has only been
  ported to Linux, Solaris, AIX, various BSD systems, Mac OS X, HP-UX, IRIX,
  and Tru64.  It is currently primarily tested on Linux.  Platforms not
  listed may require some porting effort, as may old or unusual platforms
  that aren't regularly tested.

  The lbcdclient program requires Perl 5.6 or later and requires the
  IO::Socket::INET6 module for IPv6 support.

    Currently, the test suite only checks the portability and utility
    libraries, not the functionality of lbcd or lbcdclient.
