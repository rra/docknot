blurb: |
  Term::ANSIColor provides constants and simple functions for setting ANSI
  text attributes, most notably colors.  It can be used to set the current
  text attributes or to apply a set of attributes to a string and reset the
  current text attributes at the end of that string.  Eight-color,
  sixteen-color, and 256-color escape sequences are all supported.

description: |
  This Perl module is a simple and convenient interface to the ANSI terminal
  escape sequences for color (from ECMA-48, also included in ISO 6429).  The
  color sequences are provided in two forms, either as constants for each
  color or via a function that takes the names of colors and returns the
  appropriate escape codes or wraps them around the provided text.  The
  non-color text style codes from ANSI X3.64 (bold, dark, underline, and
  reverse, for example), which were also included in ECMA-48 and ISO 6429,
  are also supported.  Also supported are the extended colors used for
  sixteen-color and 256-color emulators.

  This module is very stable, and I've used it in a wide variety of
  applications.  It has been included in the core Perl distribution starting
  with version 5.6.0, so you don't need to download and install it yourself
  unless you have an old version of Perl or need a newer version of the
  module than comes with your version of Perl.  I continue to maintain it as
  a separate module, and the version included in Perl is resynced with mine
  before each release.

  The original module came out of a discussion in comp.lang.perl.misc and is
  a combination of two approaches, one with constants by Zenin and one with
  functions that I wrote.  I offered to maintain a combined module that
  included both approaches.

    Ah, September, when the sysadmins turn colors and fall off the trees....
requirements: |
  Term::ANSIColor is written in pure Perl and has no module dependencies
  that aren't found in Perl core.  It should work with any version of Perl
  after 5.6, although it hasn't been tested with old versions in some time.

  In order to actually see color, you will need to use a terminal window
  that supports the ANSI escape sequences for color.  Any recent version of
  xterm, most xterm derivatives and replacements, and most telnet and ssh
  clients for Windows and Macintosh should work, as will the MacOS X
  Terminal application (although Terminal.app reportedly doesn't support 256
  colors).  The console windows for Windows NT and Windows 2000 will not
  work, as they do not even attempt to support ANSI X3.64.

  For a complete (to my current knowledge) compatibility list, see the
  Term::ANSIColor module documentation.  If you have any additions to the
  table in the documentation, please send them to me.

  The test suite requires Test::More (part of Perl since 5.6.2).  The
  following additional Perl modules will be used by the test suite if
  present:

  * Devel::Cover
  * Test::MinimumVersion
  * Test::Perl::Critic
  * Test::Pod
  * Test::Pod::Coverage
  * Test::Spelling
  * Test::Strict
  * Test::Synopsis
  * Test::Warn

  All are available on CPAN.  Those tests will be skipped if the modules are
  not available.
