rra-c-util comes with an extensive test suite, which you can run after
building with:

```
    make check
```

If a test fails, you can run a single test with verbose output via:

```
    tests/runtests -o <name-of-test>
```

Do this instead of running the test program directly since it will ensure
that necessary environment variables are set up.
