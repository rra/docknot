\h2[Blurb]

rra-c-util is my collection of portability functions, utility functions,
Autoconf macros, and related shared C infrastructure, akin to gnulib but
without any GPL-covered code and additional support for Kerberos and PAM
development.  It serves as a common repository of code and infrastructure
used across multiple projects so that files have a canonical latest
version.  It's not intended for installation as a regular package;
instead, other packages are expected to copy files from here as needed.

\h2[Description]

The origins of this package are in the libinn utility library in INN.
Some of the utility and portability functions here are directly inspired
by or based on versions in older versions of INN, and I wrote and rewrote
considerable additional portability code and utility libraries when I took
over INN maintenance.  When I started maintaining other C packages, I
started copying pieces of libinn into those packages and merging it with
other portability and utility code.  Over time, each package gained a
slightly different version of various utility functions, replacements for
missing functions, and Autoconf macros.

The goal of this package is to merge all the various versions of any
portability or utility code that's used in more than one of my packages in
one place.  Then, each package can update to the latest rra-c-util version
before each release and gain from the improvements made for all other
packages.  You can think of it as my version of
\link[https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/][Gnulib], with everything
released under a permissive license (no GPL).

As well as C portability frameworks, Autoconf macros, and a general C
utility library, this package has also accumulated a considerable
collection of standard tests (for C and Perl packages) and a large library
of test utilities and support functions.  It also includes extensive
support for writing and testing PAM modules, and a portable implementation
of AFS PAGs.

This package uses the infrastructure of C TAP Harness for testing, but is
not the canonical version of \code[tests/runtests.c],
\code[tests/tap/basic.[ch]], \code[tests/tap/macros.h], or
\code[tests/tap/libtap.sh].  Those files should be pulled from
\link[https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/c-tap-harness/][C TAP Harness]
instead.

\h2[Requirements]

Everything requires a C compiler to build and expects an ISO C89 or later
C compiler and libraries.  Presence of strdup is also assumed, which is
guaranteed by POSIX 2008 but common in many earlier C libraries as well.
Otherwise, the files are meant to be copied into packages and the
requirements depend on which files one copies.

A Kerberos library, either MIT Kerberos or Heimdal, is required to build
this package as-is, since the Kerberos portability layer is built and
tested by default.  The other code will run fine without this requirement
when copied into other packages.

PAM libraries and headers are required to build the package as-is, since
the PAM supporting library is built and tested by default.  Other code can
be copied from this package without introducing a PAM dependency.

To build the the kafs portability layer, one of Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris
11, the kafs library that comes with either Heimdal or KTH Kerberos, the
kopenafs library that comes with newer OpenAFS, AFS header files (on any
other platform besides AIX or IRIX), or AFS libraries (on AIX and IRIX) is
required.  AIX binaries with AFS PAG support may not run on AIX systems
that do not have an AFS client installed due to how AIX handles system
calls.

To run the full test suite, and to use the Perl test support libraries,
Perl 5.6.2 or later is required.  The following additional Perl modules
will be used if present:

\bullet(packed)[IPC::System::Simple]
\bullet(packed)[Test::MinimumVersion]
\bullet(packed)[Test::Perl::Critic]
\bullet(packed)[Test::Pod]
\bullet(packed)[Test::Spelling]
\bullet(packed)[Test::Strict]

All are available on CPAN.  Those tests will be skipped if the modules are
not available.

To bootstrap from a Git checkout, or if you change the Automake files and
need to regenerate Makefile.in, you will need Automake 1.11 or later.  For
bootstrap or if you change configure.ac or any of the m4 files it includes
and need to regenerate configure or config.h.in, you will need Autoconf
2.64 or later.  Perl is also required to generate manual pages from a
fresh Git checkout.
