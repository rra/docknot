\h2[Blurb]

DocKnot is a static web site generator built around a macro language
called thread, with special support for managing software releases.  In
addition to building a web site, it can generate distribution tarballs and
consistent human-readable software package documentation from a YAML
metadata file and templates.  The goal is to generate both web pages and
distributed documentation files (such as \code[README]) from the same
source, using templates for consistency across multiple packages.

\h2[Description]

In 1999, I wrote a program named \code[spin] that implemented an
idiosyncratic macro language called thread.  It slowly expanded into a
static web site generator and gained additional features to manage the
journal entries, book reviews, RSS feeds, and software releases.  DocKnot
is the latest incarnation.

In addition to its static web site generator, DocKnot can use one metadata
file as its source information and generate all the various bits of
documentation for a software package.  This allows me to make any changes
in one place and then regenerate the web page, included documentation, and
other files to incorporate those changes.  It also lets me make changes to
the templates to improve shared wording and push that out to every package
I maintain without having to remember track those changes in each package.

DocKnot is also slowly absorbing other tools that I use for software
distribution and web site maintenance, such as generating distribution
tarballs for software packages.

DocKnot was designed and written for my personal needs, and I'm not sure
it will be useful for anyone else.  At the least, the template files are
rather specific to my preferences about how to write package
documentation, and the thread macro language is highly specialized for my
personal web site.  I'm not sure if I'll have the time to make it a more
general tool.  But you're certainly welcome to use it if you find it
useful, send pull requests to make it more general, or take ideas from it
for your own purposes.

DocKnot is packaged in Debian 11 (bullseye) and later as docknot.  See the
\link[https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/docknot][Debian package tracker] for
more information.

DocKnot is available from CPAN as the
\link[https://metacpan.org/release/App-DocKnot] [App-DocKnot
distribution].

DocKnot is maintained using the Git version control system.  To check out
the current development tree, see
