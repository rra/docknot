\h2[Blurb]

Term::ANSIColor provides constants and simple functions for setting ANSI
text attributes, most notably colors.  It can be used to set the current
text attributes or to apply a set of attributes to a string and reset the
current text attributes at the end of that string.  Eight-color,
sixteen-color, and 256-color escape sequences are all supported.

\h2[Description]

This Perl module is a simple and convenient interface to the ANSI terminal
escape sequences for color (from ECMA-48, also included in ISO 6429).  The
color sequences are provided in two forms, either as constants for each
color or via a function that takes the names of colors and returns the
appropriate escape codes or wraps them around the provided text.  The
non-color text style codes from ANSI X3.64 (bold, dark, underline, and
reverse, for example), which were also included in ECMA-48 and ISO 6429,
are also supported.  Also supported are the extended colors used for
sixteen-color and 256-color emulators.

This module is very stable, and I've used it in a wide variety of
applications.  It has been included in the core Perl distribution starting
with version 5.6.0, so you don't need to download and install it yourself
unless you have an old version of Perl or need a newer version of the
module than comes with your version of Perl.  I continue to maintain it as
a separate module, and the version included in Perl is resynced with mine
before each release.

The original module came out of a discussion in comp.lang.perl.misc and is
a combination of two approaches, one with constants by Zenin and one with
functions that I wrote.  I offered to maintain a combined module that
included both approaches.

\h2[Requirements]

Term::ANSIColor is written in pure Perl and has no module dependencies
that aren't found in Perl core.  It should work with any version of Perl
after 5.6, although it hasn't been tested with old versions in some time.

In order to actually see color, you will need to use a terminal window
that supports the ANSI escape sequences for color.  Any recent version of
xterm, most xterm derivatives and replacements, and most telnet and ssh
clients for Windows and Macintosh should work, as will the MacOS X
Terminal application (although Terminal.app reportedly doesn't support 256
colors).  The console windows for Windows NT and Windows 2000 will not
work, as they do not even attempt to support ANSI X3.64.

For a complete (to my current knowledge) compatibility list, see the
Term::ANSIColor module documentation.  If you have any additions to the
table in the documentation, please send them to me.

The test suite requires Test::More (part of Perl since 5.6.2).  The
following additional Perl modules will be used by the test suite if
present:

\bullet(packed)[Devel::Cover]
\bullet(packed)[Test::MinimumVersion]
\bullet(packed)[Test::Perl::Critic]
\bullet(packed)[Test::Pod]
\bullet(packed)[Test::Pod::Coverage]
\bullet(packed)[Test::Spelling]
\bullet(packed)[Test::Strict]
\bullet(packed)[Test::Synopsis]
\bullet(packed)[Test::Warn]

All are available on CPAN.  Those tests will be skipped if the modules are
not available.
