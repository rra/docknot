C TAP Harness requires a C compiler to build.  Any ISO C89 or later C
compiler on a system supporting the Single UNIX Specification, version 3
(SUSv3) should be sufficient.  This should not be a problem on any modern
system.  The test suite and shell library require a Bourne-compatible
shell.  Outside of the test suite, C TAP Harness has no other
prerequisites or requirements.

To run the test suite, you will need Perl plus the Perl module Test::More,
which comes with Perl 5.8 or later.  The following additional Perl modules
will be used by the test suite if present:

* Test::Pod
* Test::Spelling

All are available on CPAN.  Those tests will be skipped if the modules are
not available.
