\h2[Blurb]

Pod::Thread translates POD source into thread, a macro language processed
by spin.  It supports optionally adding a table of contents and a
navigation bar to the genenerated file.  This package also includes the
pod2thread driver script, invoked automatically by spin for POD files and
pointers to POD files.

\h2[Description]

This package contains a module to translate POD into thread, an HTML macro
language.  As such, it's not very useful without
\link[https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/web/][spin], a separate
program to convert thread into HTML.  I wrote this module for my personal
needs and it may not be (and in fact probably isn't) suitable for more
general use as yet.

The eventual intention is to incorporate spin into
\link[https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/docknot/][DocKnot], at which
point this module will provide the POD support for DocKnot as a static
site generator.  I have no estimate for when that work will be done.

The conversion done by this module is mostly straightforward.  The only
notable parts are the optional generation of a table of contents or a
navigation bar at the top of the generated file.

\h2[Requirements]

Perl 5.24 or later and Pod::Parser 3.06 or later.  As mentioned above,
it's also not particularly useful without spin.
