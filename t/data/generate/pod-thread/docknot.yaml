blurb: |
  Pod::Thread translates POD source into thread, a macro language processed by
  spin.  It supports optionally adding a table of contents and a navigation
  bar to the genenerated file.  This package also includes the pod2thread
  driver script, invoked automatically by spin for POD files and pointers to
  POD files.

description: |
  This package contains a module to translate POD into thread, an HTML macro
  language.  As such, it's not very useful without
  [spin](https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/web/), a separate program to
  convert thread into HTML.  I wrote this module for my personal needs and it
  may not be (and in fact probably isn't) suitable for more general use as
  yet.

  The eventual intention is to incorporate spin into
  [DocKnot](https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/docknot/), at which point
  this module will provide the POD support for DocKnot as a static site
  generator.  I have no estimate for when that work will be done.

  The conversion done by this module is mostly straightforward.  The only
  notable parts are the optional generation of a table of contents or a
  navigation bar at the top of the generated file.

requirements: |
  Perl 5.24 or later and Pod::Parser 3.06 or later.  As mentioned above, it's
  also not particularly useful without spin.

test:
  lancaster: true
  suffix: |
    Perl6::Slurp is required by the test suite.  The following additional Perl
    modules will be used by the test suite if present:

    * Devel::Cover
    * Perl::Critic::Freenode
    * Test::MinimumVersion
    * Test::Perl::Critic
    * Test::Pod
    * Test::Spelling
    * Test::Strict
    * Test::Synopsis

    All are available on CPAN.  Those tests will be skipped if the modules
    are not available.
