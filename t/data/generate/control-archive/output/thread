    Usenet is like a herd of performing elephants with diarrhea â€” massive,
    difficult to redirect, awe-inspiring, entertaining, and a source of
    mind-boggling amounts of excrement when you least expect it.

\h2[Blurb]

This software generates an INN control.ctl configuration file from
hierarchy configuration fragments, verifies control messages using GnuPG
where possible, processes new control messages to update a newsgroup list,
archives new control messages, and exports the list of newsgroups in a
format suitable for synchronizing the newsgroup list of a Netnews news
server.  It is the software that maintains the control message and
newsgroup lists available from ftp.isc.org.

\h2[Description]

This package contains three major components:

\bullet[

  All of the configuration used to generate a \code[control.ctl] file for
  INN and the \code[PGPKEYS] and \code[README.html] files distributed with
  pgpcontrol, along with the script to generate those files.

]
\bullet[

  Software to process control messages, verify them against that
  authorization information, and maintain a control message archive and
  list of active newsgroups.  Software is also included to generate
  reports of recent changes to the list of active newsgroups.

]
\bullet[

  The documentation files included in the control message archive and
  newsgroup lists on ftp.isc.org.

]
Manual changes to the canonical newsgroup list are supported in a way that
generates the same log messages and uses the same locking structure so
that they can co-exist with automated changes and be included in the same
reports.

This is the software that generates the
\link[ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/usenet/CONFIG/][active newsgroup lists] and
\link[ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/usenet/control/][control message archive]
hosted on ftp.isc.org, and the source of the \code[control.ctl] file
provided with INN.

For a web presentation of the information recorded here, as well as other
useful information about Usenet hierarchies, please see the
\link[http://usenet.trigofacile.com/hierarchies/][list of Usenet managed
hierarchies].

\h2[Requirements]

Perl 5.6 or later plus the following additional Perl modules are required:

\bullet(packed)[Compress::Zlib (included in Perl 5.10 and later)]
\bullet(packed)[Date::Parse (part of TimeDate)]
\bullet(packed)[Net::NNTP (included in Perl 5.8 and later)]
\bullet(packed)[Text::Template]

\link[https://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/][gzip] and
\link[http://www.bzip.org/][bzip2] are required.  Both are generally available
with current operating systems, possibly as supplemental packages.

process-control expects to be fed file names and message IDs of control
messages on standard input and therefore needs to be run from a news
server or some other source of control messages.  A minimalist news server
like tinyleaf is suitable for this (I wrote tinyleaf, available as part of
\link[https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/inn/][INN], for this purpose).
