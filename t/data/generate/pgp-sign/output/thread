\h2[Blurb]

PGP::Sign is a Perl module for generating and verifying detached OpenPGP
signatures of textual data using GnuPG.  It was written to support Netnews
article signatures for signed control messages and PGPMoose.

\h2[Description]

PGP::Sign is a Perl module that can generate and verify OpenPGP signatures
on some data.  Currently, only textual data (data that can be processed
using GnuPG's \code[--textmode] option) is supported.  It uses GnuPG under
the hood to do the work.

The original purpose of this module was to factor out common code in a
News::Article class written by Andrew Gierth that handled PGPMoose and
control message signatures.  It is used to verify control message
signatures for the ftp.isc.org Netnews metadata archive, and to generate
signed control messages for the Big Eight Usenet hierarchies.

Data to be signed or verified can be passed into PGP::Sign in a wide
variety of formats: scalars, arrays, open files, even code references that
act as generators.  Keys with passphrases are supported and the passphrase
is passed to GnuPG securely (although getting the passphrase to the
PGP::Sign module is a problem for the calling application).

This module supports both GnuPG v2 and GnuPG v1 and, when used with GnuPG
v1, supports using OpenPGP keys and generating and verifying signatures
that are backward-compatible with PGP 2.6.2.

PGP::Sign provides both a (recommended) object-oriented API and a (legacy)
function-based API that uses global variables for configuration and is
backward-compatible with earlier versions of PGP::Sign.

\h2[Requirements]

Perl 5.20 or later and Module::Build are required to build this module,
and IPC::Run is required to use it.  Either GnuPG v2 or GnuPG v1
(selectable at runtime) is also required.  It has not been tested with
versions of GnuPG older than 1.4.23.

PGP::Sign uses IPC::Run features that are documented as not available on
Windows (primarily higher-numbered file descriptors) and has never been
tested with Gpg4win, so will probably not work on Windows (or, for that
matter, other non-UNIX systems).
