Before setting up the wallet server, review the Wallet::Config
documentation (with man Wallet::Config or perldoc Wallet::Config).  There
are many customization options, some of which must be set.  You may also
need to create a Kerberos keytab for the keytab object backend and give it
appropriate ACLs, and set up `keytab-backend` and its `remctld`
configuration on your KDC if you want unchanging flag support.

For the basic setup and configuration of the wallet server, see the file
`docs/setup` in the source distribution.  You will need to set up a
database on the server (unless you're using SQLite), initialize the
database, install `remctld` and the wallet Perl modules, and set up
`remctld` to run the `wallet-backend` program.

The wallet client supports reading configuration settings from the system
`krb5.conf` file.  For more information, see the CONFIGURATION section of
the wallet client man page (`man wallet`).
