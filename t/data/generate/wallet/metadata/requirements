The wallet client requires the C
[remctl](https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/remctl/) client library and
a Kerberos library.  It will build with either MIT Kerberos or Heimdal.

The wallet server is written in Perl and requires Perl 5.8.0 or later plus
the following Perl modules:

* Date::Parse (part of the TimeDate distribution)
* DBI
* DBIx::Class
* Module::Build
* SQL::Translator

You will also need a DBD Perl module for the database backend that you
intend to use, and the DateTime::Format::* module corresponding to that
DBD module (such as DateTime::Format::SQLite or DateTime::Format::PG).

Currently, the server has only been tested against SQLite 3, MySQL 5, and
PostgreSQL, and prebuilt SQL files (for database upgrades) are only
provided for those servers.  It will probably not work fully with other
database backends.  Porting is welcome.

The wallet server is intended to be run under `remctld` and use `remctld`
to do authentication.  It can be ported to any other front-end, but doing
so will require writing a new version of `server/wallet-backend` that
translates the actions in that protocol into calls to the Wallet::Server
Perl object.

The keytab support in the wallet server supports Heimdal and MIT Kerberos
KDCs and has experimental support for Active Directory.  The Heimdal
support requires the Heimdal::Kadm5 Perl module.  The MIT Kerberos support
requires the MIT Kerberos `kadmin` client program be installed.  The
Active Directory support requires the Net::LDAP, Authen::SASL, and
IPC::Run Perl modules and the `msktutil` client program.

To support the unchanging flag on keytab objects with an MIT Kerberos KDC,
the Net::Remctl Perl module (shipped with remctl) must be installed on the
server and the `keytab-backend` script must be runnable via remctl on the
KDC.  This script also requires an MIT Kerberos `kadmin.local` binary that
supports the `-norandkey` option to `ktadd`.  This option is included in
MIT Kerberos 1.7 and later.

The WebAuth keyring object support in the wallet server requires the
WebAuth Perl module from
[WebAuth 4.4.0 or later](https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/webauth/).

The Duo integration object support in the wallet server requires the
[Net::Duo](https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/net-duo/), JSON, and
Perl6::Slurp Perl modules.

The password object support in the wallet server requires the
Crypt::GeneratePassword Perl module.

The LDAP attribute ACL verifier requires the Authen::SASL and Net::LDAP
Perl modules.  This verifier only works with LDAP servers that support
GSS-API binds.

The NetDB ACL verifier (only of interest at sites using NetDB to manage
DNS) requires the Net::Remctl Perl module.
