The wallet is a system for managing secure data, authorization rules to
retrieve or change that data, and audit rules for documenting actions
taken on that data.  Objects of various types may be stored in the wallet
or generated on request and retrieved by authorized users.  The wallet
tracks ACLs, metadata, and trace information.  It is built on top of the
remctl protocol and uses Kerberos GSS-API authentication.  One of the
object types it supports is Kerberos keytabs, making it suitable as a
user-accessible front-end to Kerberos kadmind with richer ACL and metadata
operations.
