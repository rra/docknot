BLURB

  Term::ANSIColor provides constants and simple functions for setting ANSI
  text attributes, most notably colors.  It can be used to set the current
  text attributes or to apply a set of attributes to a string and reset
  the current text attributes at the end of that string.  Eight-color,
  sixteen-color, and 256-color escape sequences are all supported.

DESCRIPTION

  This Perl module is a simple and convenient interface to the ANSI
  terminal escape sequences for color (from ECMA-48, also included in ISO
  6429).  The color sequences are provided in two forms, either as
  constants for each color or via a function that takes the names of
  colors and returns the appropriate escape codes or wraps them around the
  provided text.  The non-color text style codes from ANSI X3.64 (bold,
  dark, underline, and reverse, for example), which were also included in
  ECMA-48 and ISO 6429, are also supported.  Also supported are the
  extended colors used for sixteen-color and 256-color emulators.

  This module is very stable, and I've used it in a wide variety of
  applications.  It has been included in the core Perl distribution
  starting with version 5.6.0, so you don't need to download and install
  it yourself unless you have an old version of Perl or need a newer
  version of the module than comes with your version of Perl.  I continue
  to maintain it as a separate module, and the version included in Perl is
  resynced with mine before each release.

  The original module came out of a discussion in comp.lang.perl.misc and
  is a combination of two approaches, one with constants by Zenin and one
  with functions that I wrote.  I offered to maintain a combined module
  that included both approaches.

REQUIREMENTS

  Term::ANSIColor is written in pure Perl and has no module dependencies
  that aren't found in Perl core.  It should work with any version of Perl
  after 5.6, although it hasn't been tested with old versions in some
  time.

  In order to actually see color, you will need to use a terminal window
  that supports the ANSI escape sequences for color.  Any recent version
  of xterm, most xterm derivatives and replacements, and most telnet and
  ssh clients for Windows and Macintosh should work, as will the MacOS X
  Terminal application (although Terminal.app reportedly doesn't support
  256 colors).  The console windows for Windows NT and Windows 2000 will
  not work, as they do not even attempt to support ANSI X3.64.

  For a complete (to my current knowledge) compatibility list, see the
  Term::ANSIColor module documentation.  If you have any additions to the
  table in the documentation, please send them to me.

  The test suite requires Test::More (part of Perl since 5.6.2).  The
  following additional Perl modules will be used by the test suite if
  present:

  * Devel::Cover
  * Test::MinimumVersion
  * Test::Perl::Critic
  * Test::Pod
  * Test::Pod::Coverage
  * Test::Spelling
  * Test::Strict
  * Test::Synopsis
  * Test::Warn

  All are available on CPAN.  Those tests will be skipped if the modules
  are not available.

  To enable tests that don't detect functionality problems but are used to
  sanity-check the release, set the environment variable RELEASE_TESTING
  to a true value.  To enable tests that may be sensitive to the local
  environment or that produce a lot of false positives without uncovering
  many problems, set the environment variable AUTHOR_TESTING to a true
  value.

BUILDING AND INSTALLATION

  Term::ANSIColor uses ExtUtils::MakeMaker and can be installed using the
  same process as any other ExtUtils::MakeMaker module:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

  You'll probably need to do the last as root unless you're installing
  into a local Perl module tree in your home directory.

SUPPORT

  The Term::ANSIColor web page at:

      https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/ansicolor/

  will always have the current version of this package, the current
  documentation, and pointers to any additional resources.

  For bug tracking, use the CPAN bug tracker at:

      https://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Name=Term-ANSIColor

  However, please be aware that I tend to be extremely busy and work
  projects often take priority.  I'll save your report and get to it as
  soon as I can, but it may take me a couple of months.

SOURCE REPOSITORY

  Term::ANSIColor is maintained using Git.  You can access the current
  source on GitHub at:

      https://github.com/rra/ansicolor

  or by cloning the repository at:

      https://git.eyrie.org/git/perl/ansicolor.git

  or view the repository via the web at:

      https://git.eyrie.org/?p=perl/ansicolor.git

  The eyrie.org repository is the canonical one, maintained by the author,
  but using GitHub is probably more convenient for most purposes.  Pull
  requests are gratefully reviewed and normally accepted.  It's probably
  better to use the CPAN bug tracker than GitHub issues, though, to keep
  all Perl module issues in the same place.
