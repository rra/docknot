                       Revision history for DocKnot

7.01 - 2022-01-19

 - Correctly handle Unicode output from commands run by pointers and from
   POD processing by Pod::Thread.  Previous versions since 6.01 were
   double-encoding.  Thanks to Julien Ã‰LIE for the report.

 - Follow symlinks to ordinary files in docknot spin, just not
   directories.  The Path::Iterator::Rule conversion in 6.01 broke copying
   of files referenced by symlink.

 - The \size spin always used 1024-based units.  It now correctly uses the
   KiB, MiB, etc. abbreviations to match.

7.00 - 2022-01-17

 - Various module APIs now take Path::Tiny objects instead of string
   paths.  Roughly, any module API that is not called directly by
   App::DocKnot::Command now expects paths in the form of Path::Tiny
   objects and does not always do an explicit conversion.

 - Fix Unicode handling in App::DocKnot::Spin::Thread methods.  Output to
   files was handled correctly in most cases, but output to a scalar or to
   standard output was not, nor was output to a file when the input was
   generated by another program.

 - Fix processing of old-style pointers in docknot spin.

 - Fix import error when running docknot release.

 - Fix .versions updating via docknot release when the package that needs
   to be udpated is not the first line of the file.

 - When spinning an input tree, process all .rss files first in a separate
   pass.  This ensurse the output files are seen when spinning the tree
   into the output directory.

 - Ensure docknot dist always regenerates the *.tar.xz file if necessary,
   rather than reusing one left over from a previous build of the same
   version.

 - Always recreate GnuPG signatures when generating distribution tarballs
   in docknot dist.

 - When copying distribution files with docknot release, also copy the
   modification timestamps of those files.
