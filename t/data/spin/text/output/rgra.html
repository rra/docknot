<p>
rec.games.roguelike.announce is a moderated newsgroup for informational
posts and announcements about any roguelike game, including (but not
limited to) Rogue, Nethack, Moria, Angband, and Adom.  Since it is a
moderated group, all postings will be sent to a moderator for approval
before posting; this means that posts won't show up immediately after you
post them.  Please allow a day or two for your post to show up.
</p>

<p>
The charter for the group is:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
  rec.games.roguelike.announce is a forum for postings of FAQ lists,
  announcements of new patches and versions of existing games, postings of
  small "official" patches, and announcements of new rogue-style
  games. Every posting to this group would be cross-posted to the most
  appropriate other rec.games.roguelike group, and follows-up would be
  directed to that group.  The moderator could, at his/her discretion,
  change the subject line of postings (esp. to add the word [SPOILERS]
  where appropriate).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Announcements of new web sites related to roguelike games are also
appropriate and welcome.
</p>

<p>
Most posts to rec.games.roguelike.announce will be crossposted to two
newsgroups, it and the other most appropriate group in the
rec.games.roguelike.* hierarchy.  Followups will be directed to that other
group as mentioned in the charter.  Please choose your crossposting
appropriately to save work for the moderator.
</p>

<p>
Any post containing spoilers should note that in the subject header with a
tag of "[SPOILERS]".  Please also try to ensure that no spoilers occur in
the first screen of text and that the body of the article also warns about
spoilers.
</p>

<p>
All postings to rec.games.roguelike.announce except for apparent spam will
either be approved or will receive a response explaining why they were not
approved.  Note, however, that if you munge your e-mail address in a way
that the moderator cannot decipher it, there may be no way for the
response to reach you.  If you post to the group and neither receive a
response nor see your post show up within about three days, please contact
the moderator to see if there's a problem.  It's possible that your site
doesn't have the group correctly configured.
</p>

<p>
This newsgroup is also available as a mailing list.  If you wish to
receive all messages to the newsgroup as e-mail messages, go to:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
    &lt;<a href="https://lists.eyrie.org/mailman/listinfo/roguelike-announce">https://lists.eyrie.org/mailman/listinfo/roguelike-announce</a>&gt;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
to subscribe.  The content of the mailing list and newsgroup will be the
same, and all messages sent to the mailing list will be treated as
submissions for the newsgroup.
</p>

<p>
An archive of all messages to rec.games.roguelike.announce starting from
January 2010 is available at:

<p>
Also from the charter:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
  The moderator will at all times be free to appoint a backup-moderator
  and/or a replacement if he or she must leave the post.  Such an
  appointment must be announced on rec.games.roguelike.announce.  If it
  becomes necessary to replace the moderator, this could be done with a
  public vote, announced on news.announce.newgroups (and crossposted to
  all the rec.games.roguelike groups).  A two-thirds vote would be
  necessary to replace the moderator.  [It is possible that the moderator
  of news.announce.newgroups, group-advice, and such people will come up
  with an "official" way to replace a moderator; in such a case, their
  approved method would take precedence over this one.]
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The current moderator of this group is Russ Allbery &lt;eagle@eyrie.org&gt;.
The contact address for the group, to which any problem reports or
questions should be sent, is rgra-request@eyrie.org.  If you are having
problems posting directly to the group, you can instead e-mail your post
to the submission address at rgra@eyrie.org.
</p>

<p>
If you are maintaining a FAQ for any group in the rec.games.roguelike.*
hierarchy and would like to get pre-approval for posting it to
rec.games.roguelike.announce, please contact the moderator.
