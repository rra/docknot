NOTE: This document is now obsolete.  It is maintained solely for
historical reference, but this process is no longer being used for the
creation or modification of newsgroups in the Big Eight hierarchy.
See &lt;<a href="https://www.big-8.org/wiki/Main_Page">https://www.big-8.org/wiki/Main_Page</a>&gt; for information on how
proposals are currently being handled.
</p>

<p>
The text below is the unmodified text of the final version of this
document.
</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>
These guidelines document the process to create, rename, remove, or change
the moderation status of newsgroups in the Big Eight hierarchies (those
newsgroups with names starting with comp.*, humanities.*, misc.*, news.*,
rec.*, sci.*, soc.*, and talk.*).  Proposals under this process must go
through a discussion phase, a voting phase, and a verification phase as
described below.
</p>

<p>
For information on how to submit a proposal and advice on working within
this process, please see the FAQs posted to news.announce.newgroups and
news.groups.
</p>

<p>
New group proponents should be aware that the entire process typically
takes three months, and must be followed precisely.  Those who have not
proposed a group before may wish to ask group-mentors at lists.eyrie.org
for assistance.  Processes for creating groups in other hierarchies, such
as alt.*, are often quite different and sometimes much less formal; please
see the appropriate groups within those hierarchies for details.
</p>

<p>
The goal of this process is to reach consensus on a relatively stable list
of widely useful newsgroups that can be used without change at many Usenet
sites.  A Usenet site should be able to use the results of this process to
determine the list of newsgroups to carry and their moderation status
without needing to separately evaluate at each site whether a given
newsgroup should be added or dropped.  The process is biased in favor of
stability and requires that new newsgroups meet a minimum standard of
demonstrated interest.  The process also attempts to ensure new newsgroups
are reasonably named, have an acceptable moderation policy if moderated,
and would not have damaging effects on Usenet as a whole.
</p>

<p>
Most of this procedure is at the discretion of the news.announce.newgroups
(hereafter referred to as n.a.n) moderation team, who can be reached at
newgroups-request@isc.org.  All subjective determinations, particularly in
points 5-10, 12, 13, 24, 27, and 29 below, will be made by the n.a.n
moderation team.
</p>

<p>
These guidelines have been accepted by the n.a.n moderation team and may be
changed at the sole discretion of the n.a.n moderation team.
</p>

<h2>GENERAL RULE</h2>

<ol>
<li value="1">
<p>
    Only postings to news.announce.newgroups authorized by the n.a.n
    moderation team are considered official in this process.  All time
    limits and deadlines will be based on the Date headers of those posts.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>THE DISCUSSION</h2>

<ol>
<li value="2">
<p>
    A proposal officially begins with the posting of a Request for
    Discussion (RFD) in news.announce.newgroups.  A valid RFD must contain
    a rationale for the proposal, charters for all newsgroups which would
    be created or changed, and moderator information sections for all
    created or changed groups that are proposed to be moderated.  The RFD
    must be crossposted to news.groups, should be crossposted to groups
    likely to be affected by the proposal, and may be crossposted to other
    related newsgroups.
</p>
    
<p>
    Crossposts to poorly propagated or regional newsgroups may be
    disallowed at the discretion of the n.a.n moderation team.  Proposals
    will only be posted or crossposted to moderated groups with the
    explicit permission of the moderators of those groups.  The total
    length of the Newsgroups header in the RFD (and CFV) must not exceed
    200 characters, including "Newsgroups: ". The Followup-To header will
    be set to news.groups only (but see point 11).  The RFD, after it has
    been posted, may be redistributed freely.
</p>

<p>
    Due to the crosspost filters of some large ISPs, it is recommended
    (but not required) that proposals be crossposted to no more than five
    groups (including n.a.n and news.groups).
</p>
</li>

<li value="3">
<p>
    A proposal must consist of one or more of the following changes to Big
    Eight newsgroups:  Create a new newsgroup, remove an existing
    newsgroup (by subsuming it into an existing group), change the
    moderation status of an existing newsgroup, or rename a newsgroup.  No
    other types of proposals will be accepted, nor will proposals to
    create, change, or remove newsgroups outside the Big Eight.  There is
    currently a moratorium on converting unmoderated newsgroups to
    moderated newsgroups, and proposals of that type will not be accepted.
</p>
</li>

<li value="4">
<p>
    All proposed group names must be within the Big Eight hierarchies.  A
    group name is made up of name components separated by '.' (period or
    dot).  Each component must consist solely of lowercase ASCII letters,
    digits, '+' (plus), or '-' (dash), must contain at least one letter
    (a-z), and must be no more than twenty characters long.
</p>
</li>

<li value="5">
<p>
    A proposal may include multiple changes if they are closely related,
    but each individual change (as defined in point 3) will be voted on
    separately.  The n.a.n moderation team may require closely-related
    proposals submitted at the same time to be combined into a single RFD.
    The n.a.n moderation team may also require that unrelated proposals
    combined in a single RFD be split into multiple RFDs.  Once a proposal
    has been posted as an RFD, the n.a.n moderation team will not require
    that it be combined with another proposal, and instead overlapping
    proposals will be dealt with according to point 8.
</p>
</li>

<li value="6">
<p>
    A proposal that is substantially similar to a previous failed proposal
    may not be made until at least six months after the close of voting on
    the last such failed proposal.
</p>
</li>

<li value="7">
<p>
    A proposal that significantly affects the same groups as a previous
    successful proposal may not be made until at least three months after
    the implementation (point 30) of the last such successful proposal.
</p>
</li>

<li value="8">
<p>
    Two proposals with overlapping purposes, newsgroup names, or effects
    may not proceed at the same time.  Precedence is normally given to the
    first group to present a formal proposal, but repeat proposals under
    point 6 above may be handled differently at the discretion of the
    n.a.n moderation team (to prevent monopolization of a proposal).
</p>
</li>

<li value="9">
<p>
    Proposals that unmoderate or change the moderator(s) of an actively
    moderated group against the desire of the moderator(s) will be
    rejected.
</p>
</li>

<li value="10">
<p>
    Proposals may be rejected by the n.a.n moderation team in the
    extremely rare circumstance that the proposal would be opposed by
    the vast majority of news administrators or have a sufficiently
    deleterious effect on the Big Eight as a whole as to make it
    dangerously unworkable or extremely ill-advised (for example, a
    proposal for a newsgroup where the act of posting on charter would be
    almost universally illegal).
</p>
</li>

<li value="11">
<p>
    All discussion of active proposals should be posted to news.groups.
    If desired by the readership of closely affected groups, it may be
    crossposted to those groups, but care must be taken to ensure that all
    discussion appears in news.groups.
</p>
</li>

<li value="12">
<p>
    Additional RFDs for a proposal may be posted as needed, as the
    proposal changes in response to discussion.  An additional RFD is
    needed if there have been major changes to the proposal or if 60 days
    have passed since the previous RFD.  Examples of major changes include
    any change to a group's name or moderation status or a significant
    alteration to the charter.  Examples of minor changes not requiring an
    additional RFD include the addition or removal of a proponent or
    tidying up some wording in the rationale or charter.
</p>
</li>

<li value="13">
<p>
    The discussion period must be a minimum of 21 days.  If a proposal
    remains in the RFD phase for more than 120 days, the proposal may be
    suspended and a competing proposal allowed to go forward.  If it has
    been more than 120 days since the latest RFD for a proposal and a
    Proponent Questionnaire (see point 14) was not submitted within 60
    days of the latest RFD, the proposal will be considered withdrawn.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>THE VOTE</h2>

<ol>
<li value="14">
<p>
    Success or failure of a proposal will be determined by the results
    of a general interest poll conducted by a member of the Usenet
    Volunteer Votetakers (UVV).  Before the poll begins, the proponent
    must submit a Proponent Questionnaire (PQ) to the UVV.  The votetaker
    will post a CFV (Call for Votes) based on the PQ, generally to the
    same newsgroups to which the RFD was posted.  Each proposed change
    from the list in point 3 above will be voted on separately and will
    pass or fail independently.
</p>
</li>

<li value="15">
<p>
    The first CFV may be posted between 10 and 60 days after the latest
    RFD for the proposal.  At least 21 days must have elapsed between the
    first RFD and the first CFV.
</p>
</li>

<li value="16">
<p>
    The voting period will last 21 days.  The votetaker will post a second
    copy of the CFV near the middle of that period, identical to the first
    copy, except possibly for procedural or votetaker notes that do not
    modify the body of the proposal.  Only votes that arrive at the
    votetaker's machine prior to the close of voting will be considered
    valid.
</p>
</li>

<li value="17">
<p>
    The votetaker may reject votes not cast precisely according to the
    instructions in the CFV.
</p>
</li>

<li value="18">
<p>
    Only one vote per person is permitted.  If multiple votes are received
    from a single account, only the last vote will be counted, even if the
    account is used by more than one person.  Multiple votes which are, in
    the judgment of the votetaker, attempts to bypass these restrictions
    may all be rejected.
</p>
</li>

<li value="19">
<p>
    Votes from undeliverable addresses (including transformations of valid
    addresses intended to avoid spam) are not valid.  The votetaker will
    e-mail an acknowledgment of the vote in response to each vote, and if
    this acknowledgment bounces, the corresponding vote will not count
    towards the total.  Voters are responsible for investigating what
    happened if their votes are not acknowledged.
</p>
</li>

<li value="20">
<p>
    Anonymous, forwarded, or proxy votes are not valid.  Votes mailed by
    WWW/HTML/CGI forms are considered proxy votes and are not valid.  The
    precise definition of anonymous is at the discretion of the votetaker
    but should not be interpreted as requiring all voters to use their
    real name; votes from well-established pseudonyms should be accepted.
</p>
</li>

<li value="21">
<p>
    The explicit voting instructions in the CFV may not be distributed, in
    whole or in part, to any forum, by anyone except the votetaker.
    People wishing to vote should be referred to the CFV posted in
    news.announce.newgroups or told to contact the votetaker for a copy.
    Violations may result in invalidation of votes by the votetaker or
    long-term suspension of the proposal by the n.a.n moderation team.
</p>
</li>

<li value="22">
<p>
    Whether or not the CFV may be sent to mailing lists is at the
    discretion of the votetaker, and if done should only be done by the
    votetaker directly.
</p>
</li>

<li value="23">
<p>
    The validity of any given vote is determined by the votetaker.  Votes
    may be disqualified for violation of the above points or for any other
    actions seriously detrimental to the integrity of the vote, at the
    discretion of the votetaker.  The decision of the votetaker may be
    appealed to the n.a.n moderation team.  The decision of the n.a.n
    moderation team is final.
</p>
</li>

<li value="24">
<p>
    If there are significant problems with the vote, if the votetaker is
    unable to collect the votes, or if there are other serious flaws in
    the voting procedure, the n.a.n moderation team will normally cancel
    the vote and hold an immediate revote without disclosing the results
    of the first vote.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>THE RESULT</h2>

<ol>
<li value="25">
<p>
    After the completion of the vote, the votetaker will tally the result
    and post it to the same newsgroups to which the votetaker posted the
    CFV.  The posted result will contain the name, a form of the e-mail
    address, and the vote of everyone who voted except for those people
    who subsequently cancelled their vote.
</p>
</li>

<li value="26">
<p>
    Each separate proposed change will be considered to have passed if and
    only if it received at least 100 more YES than NO votes and received
    at least twice as many YES as NO votes.
</p>
</li>

<li value="27">
<p>
    After the result posting, there will be a five day period when any
    objections to the vote may be raised in news.groups.  The n.a.n
    moderation team should also be informed (at newgroups-request@isc.org)
    of any objections or inaccuracies that could change the outcome.
</p>
</li>

<li value="28">
<p>
    At the conclusion of this waiting period, the n.a.n moderation team
    will either validate the results or will put the proposal on hold
    while objections are considered.  The final determination of whether a
    vote has passed or failed will be made by the n.a.n moderation team;
    the n.a.n moderation team may also call for a revote or take other
    appropriate action to deal with severely flawed votes.
</p>
</li>

<li value="29">
<p>
    The results of a vote may be accepted despite flaws in the voting
    process.  If the voting period lasted at least 21 days with at least
    one posted CFV and the flaws are, in the determination of the n.a.n
    moderator, extremely unlikely to have caused a change in the outcome,
    the n.a.n moderator may accept the voting results even if the above
    procedure is not followed exactly.
</p>
</li>

<li value="30">
<p>
    All portions of the proposal that passed will be implemented by
    control messages issued by the n.a.n moderation team.  Control
    messages will generally be sent shortly after the waiting period
    (point 27) and final validation of the results, but may be delayed
    due to major holidays, initial setup of moderation, or transition
    periods (for example, during renames, removal of an existing group
    may be delayed until creation of its replacement has had time to
    propagate).
