<h2><a name="S1" id="S1">1. Introduction and Overview</a></h2>

<p>
This FAQ is no longer actively maintained.  Its author no longer uses
either qmail or Majordomo.  It is preserved in case anyone still finds it
useful, but further updates are not being made and some of the information
below is probably out of date.
</p>

<p>
This FAQ describes how to get Majordomo 1.94 working under a pure qmail
system (one without qmsmac or some other emulation of sendmail's
/etc/alias handling).  A standard Majordomo installation relies heavily on
sendmail aliases, and while it is possible to do the obvious thing and set
up Majordomo using .qmail files in ~alias instead, there are actually
considerably better ways.
</p>

<p>
This FAQ assumes that you understand how to do a stock installation of
Majordomo.  This FAQ is not aimed at the Majordomo novice, but rather at
someone who has set up Majordomo before under non-qmail systems and now
wants to set it up on a qmail system (or upgrade an existing non-qmail
system running Majordomo to qmail).  For basic questions on how to install
Majordomo, see the documentation that comes with it.
</p>

<p>
It is expected that Majordomo 2.x will handle qmail directly, so this FAQ
is only interim documentation.  A release date for for Majordomo 2.x has
not yet been set.
</p>

<p>
This FAQ owes a great deal to the documentation and scripts written by
Giles Lean and Chael Hall, which I used as a starting point for my own
experimentation.  Giles also provided valuable feedback, corrections, and
rewordings.  Information on digests is largely from Lindsay Haisley.
</p>


<h2><a name="S1.1" id="S1.1">1.1. Why qmail is different</a></h2>

<p>
In setting up Majordomo with qmail, there are two classes of things to
think about:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
   minimal changes from a stock (sendmail) installation to make
   Majordomo work, and
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
   further changes to adjust majordomo to better fit qmail's philosophy.
   Making these additional changes is highly recommended.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
qmail is more than just a different MTA (mail transport agent).  It also
has a fundamentally different philosophy than sendmail in a lot of
respects.  It's possible, using the information contained in this FAQ, to
adjust Majordomo to fit into qmail's philosophy, which in my opinion will
result in a much better overall list management system than just making a
few minor changes to a Majordomo installation to get it working.
</p>


<h2><a name="S1.2" id="S1.2">1.2. Potential problems</a></h2>

<p>
Before getting into the technical details of setting up Majordomo, you
should be aware of some general potential problems with using qmail and
Majordomo together.
</p>

<p>
One of the advantages that qmail has over sendmail is that it's a much
faster and more efficient MTA.  It receives mail faster and, more to the
point, it sends mail faster.  Furthermore, in order to support VERP (where
every mail message sent to the list has a different envelope sender so
that bounces can be easily associated with a subscribed address), it may
send each list message as a separate mail message.  sendmail under some
circumstances does more blocking, sending one message with multiple
envelope recipients if all recipients are at the same host.
</p>

<p>
This can result in qmail putting a much higher load on remote mail
servers, particularly if you have a large number of list subscribers at
one remote host, and particularly if that remote host is not also running
qmail.  If you're running large lists on a qmail mail server, you may wish
to seriously consider decreasing control/concurrencyremote to something
lower than the default of 20 so that qmail won't open 20 simultaneous
connections to that remote host.  (On the other hand, if the remote hosts
can handle it, you may want to consider <strong>increasing</strong> concurrencyremote so
that list mail goes out faster.)
</p>


<h2><a name="S1.3" id="S1.3">1.3. Stages of setup</a></h2>

<p>
There are basically two things one has to worry about to get Majordomo
working:  routing incoming mail to the correct Majordomo program, and
letting Majordomo send outgoing mail to the mailing lists.  The remainder
of this document describes how to set up each part.
</p>

<p>
The routing of incoming email to the majordomo programs requires changes,
since qmail doesn't use the /etc/aliases method described in the Majordomo
installation instructions.  The minimal changes required to get Majordomo
working are to create .qmail files in ~alias for every list and
administrative address.  (At this point, experienced Majordomo installers
will be wondering how to hide the outgoing alias; how to either do this or
protect it from external mail is described later.)
</p>

<p>
A stock Majordomo installation can send outgoing mail just fine under
qmail (with the addition of a .qmail file linked to the list address file
so that resend has an address to send to).  For reasons of speed, bounce
handling and loop detection, you may wish to have Majordomo send mail
using a program that talks more directly to the qmail system rather than
through qmail's sendmail emulation.
</p>


<h2><a name="S2" id="S2">2. Handing incoming list mail</a></h2>

<p>
For each mailing list run on your system, you need to be able to accept
mail at the list address and an associated owner address (either
list-owner or owner-list) at a bare minimum.  You may also want to accept
mail at list-request (for administrative requests) and list-approval (for
subscription and unsubscription notification and approval).  The standard
Majordomo addresses (majordomo and majordomo-owner) should also work as
expected.
</p>

<p>
This section deals with configuring qmail so that mail to those addresses
is routed to the correct Majordomo program.
</p>

<p>
A default installation of Majordomo uses a wrapper program (written in C
and installed setuid root) to change users to the Majordomo user.
</p>


<h2><a name="S2.1" id="S2.1">2.1. The simple approach</a></h2>

<p>
The easiest method to use is qmail's alias mechanism.  Just create .qmail
files for each of the list administrative and submission addresses for
each of your lists in ~alias.  The files needed for each list are:
</p>

<pre>    .qmail-LIST
    .qmail-owner-LIST
    .qmail-LIST-approval</pre>

<p>
where LIST is the name of the mailing list.  These files should contain
the standard Majordomo aliases; in other words, .qmail-LIST should have:
</p>

<pre>    |/path/to/majordomo/wrapper resend -l LIST LIST-outgoing</pre>

<p>
.qmail-owner-LIST should contain the e-mail address of the owner of the
mailing list, and so forth.  This is the direct qmail analog of setting up
the standard Majordomo aliases in /etc/aliases.  (Keep in mind that qmail
specifies that all e-mail addresses in .qmail files should be fully
qualified.)  You may also want to add a .qmail-LIST-request file
containing the standard request program invocation.
</p>

<p>
Finally, create ~alias/.qmail-majordomo containing the standard Majordomo
invocation and ~alias/.qmail-majordomo-owner containing the Majordomo
administrator's e-mail address.
</p>


<h2><a name="S2.2" id="S2.2">2.2. Eliminating Majordomo's wrapper program</a></h2>

<p>
While the above method will certainly work, it still uses Majordomo's
wrapper program to switch users from alias to the Majordomo user.  One
could just not use the wrapper program and let Majordomo run as alias, but
this is probably a bad idea from a security standpoint (the alias user may
be doing a variety of other things).
</p>

<p>
qmail already has a facility built in for changing UIDs to the user whose
mail is being delivered, and in fact probably does so more robustly than
Majordomo's wrapper does.  It makes a great deal of sense to eliminate
Majordomo's wrapper program entirely under qmail and let qmail do the user
switching.
</p>

<p>
There are two basic ways to do this.  The simplest is with the virtual
domain system, described in section 2.3, but this requires that you have
the ability to set up a DNS MX record for a separate host name that will
only be handling mailing list mail.  A more complicated solution that
doesn't require that is to use the qmail-users mechanism as described in
section 2.4.
</p>

<p>
Under either approach, you'll need to set up .qmail files to handle the
incoming mail, which will now be delivered according to .qmail files in
the Majordomo user's home directory and with the UID and GID of the
delivery program already set to the appropriate user and group.  The
simplest way to handle this is to create .qmail files in the Majordomo
user's home directory similar to those described in section 2.1, except
leaving off the wrapper.  For example, if Majordomo were installed in
/var/qmail/majordomo, .qmail-LIST would just contain:
</p>

<pre>    |/var/qmail/majordomo/resend -l LIST LIST-outgoing</pre>

<p>
Also create a .qmail file containing:
</p>

<pre>    |/var/qmail/majordomo/majordomo</pre>

<p>
and a .qmail-owner file containing the e-mail address of the Majordomo
administrator.
</p>

<p>
There are two ways to deal with the fact that the standard Majordomo
sender address for list mail is owner-LIST instead of the more natural (at
least for qmail) LIST-owner.  One is to create then create
.qmail-owner-LIST files for each list (and add a line to users/append as
mentioned in the previous section if you're using qmail-users).  Another,
more natural approach is to change Majordomo to use LIST-owner.  To do
that, go through the .config files for each of your mailing lists and
change the "sender" setting to LIST-owner instead of the default.  You'll
also want to install a small to majordomo to make that the default for new
lists and for times when the configuration file couldn't be read.  You can
get that patch from:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
    &lt;<a href="https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/mjqmail/">https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/mjqmail/</a>&gt;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The last issue to be aware of in eliminating the wrapper is that the
wrapper sets a variety of environment variables which will now no longer
be set.  The only one that actually causes problems is MAJORDOMO_CF.
Since it won't be set, all of the Majordomo programs will fall back on
/etc/majordomo.cf, which probably isn't correct.  If it's not, edit all
Majordomo programs you're running from aliases (resend, majordomo,
request-answer, etc.), search for MAJORDOMO_CF, and change the fallback
path to the correct path for majordomo.cf.
</p>


<h2><a name="S2.3" id="S2.3">2.3. Using virtual domains</a></h2>

<p>
A virtual domain allows you to delegate an entire domain to a particular
user.  Using virtual domains requires that you have sufficient control
over your DNS to set up a particular hostname just for your mailing lists.
You'll need to be able to pick an address, like lists.example.com, and set
up an MX record for it pointing to your mail server.  If you're not able
to do this, use the qmail-users mechanism described in the next section.
</p>

<p>
Choose the subdomain that you're going to give to Majordomo (such as
lists.example.com).  Add a line to /var/qmail/control/virtualdomains that
looks like:
</p>

<pre>    lists.example.com:lists</pre>

<p>
replacing lists.example.com with your virtual domain and lists with your
Majordomo user.  All addresses in that domain will now be handled by
.qmail files in the Majordomo user's home directory (well, after qmail is
restarted or qmail-send gets a HUP signal).  See the qmail-send man page
for more details.
</p>

<p>
It's possible to use the virtual domain system under qmail 1.03 or later
to delegate individual addresses rather than whole domains to a particular
user.  This would potentially allow one to use virtual domains even
without a separate hostname and MX record for mailing lists.  That would
require listing every individual list address in the virtualdomains file,
though, so using the qmail-users mechanism is probably simpler for that
case.
</p>


<h2><a name="S2.4" id="S2.4">2.4. Using qmail-users</a></h2>

<p>
The qmail-users man page, along with the documentation for qmail-pw2u and
qmail-newu, contains the full details on how the qmail-users mechanism
works, but basically qmail-pw2u is run on the password file to generate a
list of addresses mail is accepted at, what UID and GID to switch to when
delivering mail for a user, and where to deliver the mail (the user's home
directory).
</p>

<p>
Assuming that Majordomo is installed in /var/qmail/majordomo, create
/var/qmail/users/mailnames if it doesn't exist and add the following:
</p>

<pre>    lists:lists:majordomo</pre>

<p>
(replacing lists with the name of your Majordomo user).  This will be used
for the standard majordomo and majordomo-owner addresses.  Then, for each
list, add a line to /var/qmail/users/subusers of the form:
</p>

<pre>    LIST:lists:LIST:</pre>

<p>
(again, replacing lists with the name of your Majordomo user and replacing
LIST by the name of the list).  After this is done and you run qmail-pw2u,
all incoming mail to LIST and LIST-anything will be controlled by .qmail
files in Majordomo's home directory.
</p>

<p>
(Note that you may not want the home directory of the Majordomo user to be
the same as the Majordomo installation directory, for various reasons.
One reason to make them different is that qmail-pw2u likes to have the
home directory of a user be owned by that user and you may not want to
have the directory containing the main Majordomo scripts owned by the
Majordomo user for security reasons.)
</p>

<p>
If you're not going to patch Majordomo to use LIST-owner addresses instead
of owner-LIST addresses, you may also want to add the line:
</p>

<pre>    +owner-:lists:401:201:/var/qmail/majordomo:-:owner-:</pre>

<p>
to /var/qmail/users/append, replacing the user, UID, GID, and home
directory as appropriate for your installation, so that all mail addressed
to owner-anything will be handled by the Majordomo user.
</p>

<p>
Note that you may be able to avoid using the qmail-users mechanism for all
of your addresses by not including the alias lines in users/assign and
letting qmail-lspawn fall back on reading /etc/passwd.  If you choose to
do this, you can just put the lines for Majordomo in users/assign directly
and don't need to use qmail-pw2u.  See the man page for more details.
</p>


<h2><a name="S2.5" id="S2.5">2.5. Cutting down on .qmail files</a></h2>

<p>
Using the above instructions for setting up the incoming mail addresses,
one ends up with three or four .qmail files per list, most of whose
contents are algorithmically determinable from the name of the list.  If
you're like me, that seems like a lot of clutter, and it may be worthwhile
to use a program to resend incoming mail to the right place depending on
the address rather than using .qmail files and having qmail do it.
</p>

<p>
One script for doing this for the common cases of -owner, -request,
-approval, and the list submission address itself is available from:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
    &lt;<a href="https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/mjqmail/">https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/mjqmail/</a>&gt;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Patches and pointers to additional scripts that can handle more cases are
welcome.
</p>

<p>
Using a script like this, one simply creates a .qmail-default file in the
Majordomo directory that pipes incoming mail to the script.  Note that by
doing it that way, if there are any particular addresses which <strong>shouldn't</strong>
go to the script, it's trivial to override them just by creating a
separate .qmail file for those special cases.  .qmail-default is only
checked if no more specific .qmail files exist.
</p>


<h2><a name="S3" id="S3">3. Sending outgoing list mail</a></h2>

<p>
Once the Majordomo system has received the mail, it has to send it out
again to the mailing list.  Normally this is done using the Majordomo
program resend.  (It's possible to have the list submission alias point
directly at the file of addresses, but it's not recommended since the
envelope sender isn't changed and none of the other things resend does can
be done.)
</p>

<p>
resend by default uses /usr/lib/sendmail to send outgoing mail, which
actually works just fine on a qmail system due to qmail's sendmail
emulation.  resend sends mail to another alias on the system, though, so
an address for resend to send mail to has to be created or the way resend
sends mail has to be changed.
</p>


<h2><a name="S3.1" id="S3.1">3.1. The simple approach</a></h2>

<p>
The easiest way to get resend working under qmail is to create a
.qmail-LIST-outgoing file and link it to the list file that Majordomo
maintains (you have to use a symbolic link, since Majordomo will break
hard links in the process of updating the address file).  In order for
this to work, your lists have to be set to strip comments from subscribed
addresses (because qmail will complain about addresses with comments).
Note also that qmail won't like any addresses which begin with
non-alphanumeric characters, which may be a problem in some circumstances.
</p>

<p>
A patch to Majordomo that causes it to reject any addresses that don't
start with alphanumeric characters was available as part of Chael Hall's
mj+qmail package, but it's not clear whether that's still available
anywhere.
</p>


<h2><a name="S3.2" id="S3.2">3.2. Privacy concerns with the simple approach</a></h2>

<p>
The problem with doing things this way is that qmail will insert a
Delivered-To header pointing at the address for the raw list file into
each outgoing message, and someone will be able to send mail directly to
the raw list address and that mail will bypass resend.  This is just an
annoyance if you're running fairly open lists; this is a fatal problem for
lists that are moderated or which use extensive spam filtering.
</p>

<p>
There are a couple of ways to deal with this problem.  One is to add a
filter as the first subscriber to every mailing list that checks incoming
mail and rejects it if it wasn't sent by Majordomo.  A good filter which
does this is available from Giles Lean's majordomo-inject page (see the
reference below).
</p>

<p>
Another, perhaps better, solution is to tell Majordomo to use something
other than qmail's sendmail emulation to send outgoing mail.  Details on
how to do that are in the next section.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the problem with the exposed raw list address, one may wish
to use something other than the sendmail emulation so that VERP envelope
senders can be added to outgoing mail.  It's possible to convince qmail to
add VERP using the simple approach by creating .qmail-LIST-outgoing-owner
and .qmail-LIST-outgoing-owner-default, but using a script to do it is
cleaner in some ways and ensures that the envelope sender is set to what
resend wants, just with VERP added, rather than LIST-outgoing-owner.
</p>

<p>
Another reason to use a separate mailing script is so that you aren't
forced into having Majordomo strip comments from the list files; a
sufficiently intelligent injection script could do that.
</p>


<h2><a name="S3.3" id="S3.3">3.3. Talking to qmail directly</a></h2>

<p>
I have an mjinject script which can be used as the outgoing mailer for
resend.  It talks to qmail-queue directly (which is considerably more
efficient than talking to the sendmail emulation or to qmail-inject), and
optionally adds VERP to outgoing messages.  It also adds a Delivered-To
header to outgoing messages pointing to the submission address for the
list, which should hopefully be effective in preventing loops.
It's available at:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
    &lt;<a href="https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/mjqmail/">https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/mjqmail/</a>&gt;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This script is a merger of Giles Lean's and my work, and he contributed
substantially to it.
</p>

<p>
As an aside, while VERP can be extremely handy in tracking down where
mailing list bounces are coming from, some defective MTAs can't handle
VERP addresses.  In particular, I've received a report that WatchGuard
firewalls reject them with "mailbox name not allowed."  So if you try
turning on VERP and suddenly start getting bounces from your mailing list,
you may want to see if any of your subscribers are behind one of those
broken MTAs.
</p>


<h2><a name="S3.4" id="S3.4">3.4. Handling digests and archives</a></h2>

<p>
First of all, when doing digests under qmail, you will almost certainly
want to handle digests as another Majordomo list.  The stand-alone method
of configuration would require a lot of porting to qmail, and why go to
the effort when you've already ported Majordomo proper?
</p>

<p>
Digests and archives are both usually created just by adding another
recipient to outgoing list mail, so one obvious way of dealing with them
is to add them as additional addresses subscribed to the mailing list.  To
avoid confusing Majordomo (and mjinject), however, you want them to be
simple addresses, which means that you would have to have potentially
exposed addresses on your system going into the digest and archive scripts
which would have to be protected.
</p>

<p>
If that isn't likely to be a problem, then creating .qmail-LIST-archive
and .qmail-LIST-digestify files in Majordomo's home directory and then
adding LIST-archive and LIST-digestify to the mailing list will cause
digests and archives to work about the same as they would work under a
sendmail Majordomo setup.
</p>

<p>
Another option is to add the invocation of digest to a .qmail-LIST file in
majordomo's home directory (creating one to override mjdispatch or a
similar program if you're using one), in addition to the invocation of
resend.  This will cause incoming messages as seen by digest to have not
gone through resend, which may or may not be what you want.  (It almost
certainly isn't what you want if you have a moderated list.)
</p>

<p>
A third option is to use the digest and archive support in mjinject (see
above).  If you're using it, and create a LIST.programs file in the lists
directory containing the command lines to run archive and/or digest,
mjinject will pipe the message (coming from resend) through those programs
as well as mailing it out to the list.  You can then use your standard way
of periodically sending out digests.
</p>

<p>
Note that the digest script itself uses the mailer setting from
majordomo.cf, so if you've modified that to use qmail-inject, digest will
as well, which in practice will require that digest be sending to a
regular Majordomo list.
</p>
