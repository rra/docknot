<h1>NPR Top 100 SFF meme</h1>

<p>
By way of <a href="http://firecat.dreamwidth.org/profile"><img src="/~eagle/journal/dw.png" alt="" /></a><a href="http://firecat.dreamwidth.org/"><strong>firecat</strong></a>, this is the result of a public nomination process,
panel review, and Internet voting on the NPR web site: an attempt at the
top 100 works of science fiction or fantasy.  Series are counted as single
works for the purposes of the list.
</p>

<p>
This list has a ton of problems, like any list of this sort will have.  It
leans rather more heavily towards white male than the actual literature,
and certainly than my reading.  The lack of non-white writers is
particularly troubling.  But it's still an interesting selection.  (For
those wondering about some obvious omissions, young adult was explicitly
excluded.)
</p>

<p>
The rules are to bold the works one has read in their entirety and
italicize the ones you've read part of but not finished.  I'll add
underlining the works that I own, which provides some indication of the
things that I've not read but that are on my to-read list.
</p>

<ol>
<li class="packed"><strong><u>The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, by J.R.R. Tolkien</u></strong>: 
    It's a boring winner because it always wins, but it's an amazing book
    and I can't argue with it.  I'll probably never review this one since
    I'm not sure I have anything original to say about it.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u>The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy, by Douglas Adams</u></strong>: 
    Probably the best humorous SF.  I've read the entire series except for
    <cite>The Salmon of Doubt</cite>, the unfinished book left when Adams died.
    Will re-read them all at some point.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u>Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card</u></strong>: 
    I intensely dislike Card's politics, but this book is still very good.
    It's on my re-read list so that I can write a proper review of it.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong>The Dune Chronicles, by Frank Herbert</strong>: 
    I've read the whole series, but only own the first, which is by far
    the best.  I'm tempted to re-read the whole series at some point,
    since I don't remember it well enough to analyze it, but I'll probably
    stop after re-reading just the first.</li>
<li class="packed"><em><a href="../../reviews/books/0-553-57340-3.html">A Song Of Ice And Fire
    Series</a>, by George R. R. Martin</em>: 
    I own the first couple and have read and reviewed the first four.  I
    think they're somewhat overrated, but will probably read the latest.
    I'm not sure if I'll re-read the previous books to remember what the
    heck was going on.</li>
<li class="packed"><u>1984, by George Orwell</u>: 
    I've somehow never read this.  I keep meaning to, particularly since I
    generally love Orwell.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong>Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury</strong>: 
    Massively overrated, or perhaps just made unoriginal by subsequent
    history.  I found it boring and uninteresting.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u>The Foundation Trilogy, by Isaac Asimov</u></strong>: 
    Thoroughly enjoyed this when I was a teenager.  I suspect I'll like it
    less as an adult, but definitely on my to-read list.</li>
<li class="packed"><u>Brave New World, by Aldous Huxley</u>: Another classic I've never read.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u>American Gods, by Neil Gaiman</u></strong>: 
    Great book.  Need to re-read to review.</li>
<li class="packed"><u>The Princess Bride, by William Goldman</u>: 
    On the list to read.  Apparently significantly better than the movie,
    which I liked less than everyone else on the planet.</li>
<li class="packed"><em>The Wheel Of Time Series, by Robert Jordan</em>: 
    I read up to book eight (<cite>The Path of Daggers</cite>) and bailed
    halfway through it.  It started as somewhat interesting fantasy with
    deep world building and fun world surprises, but the writing got worse
    and worse and the characters became miserably unlikeable.  I'm still
    occasionally tempted to re-read and finish it, but it's a bad
    temptation.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u><a href="../../reviews/books/animal-farm.html">Animal Farm</a>, by George
    Orwell</u></strong>: 
    Great book, and a political and historical classic.  Best read in
    combination with a good history.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u>Neuromancer, by William Gibson</u></strong>: Meh.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u>Watchmen, by Alan Moore</u></strong>: Brilliant.  On my list to re-read.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u>I, Robot, by Isaac Asimov</u></strong>: 
    Okay, but I generally find Asimov a bit overrated.  Good for
    intellectual puzzle stories, but not that deep of ones, and the
    characters are essentially nonentities.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong>Stranger In A Strange Land, by Robert Heinlein</strong>: 
    The only book that I've ever put down within fifteen pages of the end
    and could never muster enough caring to pick up again.  I should
    re-read it at some point to review it, but I don't think it's very
    good.</li>
<li class="packed"><u>The Kingkiller Chronicles, by Patrick Rothfuss</u>: 
    Well, I own the first one at least.</li>
<li class="packed">Slaughterhouse-Five, by Kurt Vonnegut: Need to read.</li>
<li class="packed">Frankenstein, by Mary Shelley: 
    I've never actually read this, but I'm not sure there's much point in
    reading it.  I've been so thoroughly exposed to the angles and
    interpretations of it that reading it at this point would be an odd
    experience.  I probably should for completion's sake at some point.
    (This is the first woman on the list, and of course she's long-dead
    and not writing in the modern SF tradition.)</li>
<li class="packed"><u>Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?, by Philip K. Dick</u>: 
    I do need to read more Dick.  I don't think this is as good as its
    placement on the list; everyone just knows <cite>Blade Runner</cite> (which
    was based on this).</li>
<li class="packed"><u>The Handmaid's Tale, by Margaret Atwood</u>: 
    I have a bunch of Atwood, but haven't yet read any of it.</li>
<li class="packed">The Dark Tower Series, by Stephen King: 
    It's rare for me to find any horror I actually like, but my
    understanding is that this is less horror than a lot of King.  I may
    give it a try someday (but probably won't).</li>
<li class="packed"><strong>2001: A Space Odyssey, by Arthur C. Clarke</strong>: 
    Much better than the movie since it actually explained what was going
    on, although it wasn't as atmospheric.  Not actually as good as its
    position on lists like this would indicate.  Mostly it's just a book
    everyone has heard of.</li>
<li class="packed"><u>The Stand, by Stephen King</u>: See above about horror.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u><a href="../../reviews/books/0-553-56261-4.html">Snow Crash</a>, by Neal
    Stephenson</u></strong>: 
    One of my favorite humorous SF books, plus features the trademark
    Stephenson infodumping and some neat bits about building a virtual
    world.</li>
<li class="packed"><u>The Martian Chronicles, by Ray Bradbury</u>: On the list to read.</li>
<li class="packed">Cat's Cradle, by Kurt Vonnegut: Need to track down and read.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u>The Sandman Series, by Neil Gaiman</u></strong>: 
    Quite possibly the best comic book series ever written.  Utterly
    brilliant.  The one set of graphic novels that everyone should read at
    some point in their life.</li>
<li class="packed">A Clockwork Orange, by Anthony Burgess: 
    Huh.  Not really on my radar to read, although of course I've heard of
    it.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u><a href="../../reviews/books/0-441-78358-9.html">Starship Troopers</a>, by
    Robert Heinlein</u></strong>: 
    Also overrated, particularly since it's not much of a story.  It's an
    extended and multifaceted political essay, which isn't as simple as it
    appears to be.  The movie, quite contrary to the negative impression
    people have of it, is a delightful parody of how the book comes across
    on its surface reading.</li>
<li class="packed"><u>Watership Down, by Richard Adams</u>: Yeah, yeah, I know I should read it.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u>Dragonflight, by Anne McCaffrey</u></strong>: 
    I loved the Pern books as a teenager up until the point when the just
    became retellings of the same book from a new perspective.  I'm afraid
    to re-read them.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u><a href="../../reviews/books/0-425-03436-4.html">The Moon Is A Harsh
    Mistress</a>, by Robert Heinlein</u></strong>: 
    Much, much better than <cite>Starship Troopers</cite>.  One of the better
    non-juvenile Heinleins.  Still not as good as people think it is.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u><a href="../../reviews/books/0-553-37926-7.html">A Canticle For
    Leibowitz</a>, by Walter M. Miller</u></strong>: 
    I was disappointed in this given how much people like it, but it
    deserves some credit for being foundational to post-apocalyptic SF.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u><a href="../../reviews/books/0-517-26188-Xa.html">The Time Machine</a>, by
    H.G. Wells</u></strong>: 
    More interesting than you might think it would be, given when it was
    written and the emphasis on description rather than characterization.
    But it still suffers from a lack of characters for me.  Hard to come
    to this fresh now, since the ideas have been so used elsewhere.</li>
<li class="packed">20,000 Leagues Under The Sea, by Jules Verne: 
    I've seen the movie take on it.  I've not felt a strong urge to read
    the book, although I probably "should."</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u><a href="../../reviews/books/0-553-27450-3.html">Flowers For Algernon</a>,
    by Daniel Keys</u></strong>: 
    Unforgettable and very strongly affecting (and depressing).</li>
<li class="packed"><u>The War Of The Worlds, by H.G. Wells</u>: Will read at some point.</li>
<li class="packed"><u>The Chronicles Of Amber, by Roger Zelazny</u>: Will probably read soon.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u>The Belgariad, by David Eddings</u></strong>: 
    Yeah, I read this as a teenager and quite liked it.  But I have no
    idea what it's doing on this list; it is in absolutely no way one of
    the best 100 SFF works of all time.  (Well, that's not true; I know
    what it's doing on this list.  People have heard of it and read it.
    But it shouldn't be on this list.)</li>
<li class="packed"><u>The Mists Of Avalon, by Marion Zimmer Bradley</u>: On the list.</li>
<li class="packed">The Mistborn Series, by Brandon Sanderson: Want to read this.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u>Ringworld, by Larry Niven</u></strong>: 
    Interesting idea fiction with a great sense of scale.  Shame the
    characters aren't as good as the background.  But it's a good book,
    worth reading.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u><a href="../../reviews/books/0-441-47812-3.html">The Left Hand Of
    Darkness</a>, by Ursula K. LeGuin</u></strong>: 
    A deserved classic of anthropological SF with profound things to say
    about how culture and friendship are constructed.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u>The Silmarillion, by J.R.R. Tolkien</u></strong>: 
    I love this book, but the first section is hard going if you don't
    like reading mythology.  Skip ahead if you're struggling; the gems are
    later.</li>
<li class="packed"><u>The Once And Future King, by T.H. White</u>: Definitely on the list to read.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u>Neverwhere, by Neil Gaiman</u></strong>: 
    I'm not sure I'd put it on this list, as there are better Gaiman (and
    Gaiman is already overrepresented), but it's a solid "urban" fantasy
    in the old sense of that term.  Inventive, with a feel similar to some
    of the <cite>Sandman</cite> stories.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u>Childhood's End, by Arthur C. Clarke</u></strong>: 
    I read this eons ago and can barely remember it.  I definitely need to
    re-read it.</li>
<li class="packed">Contact, by Carl Sagan: 
    Liked the movie, have never had any particular urge to read the book.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u><a href="../../reviews/books/0-553-28368-5.html">The Hyperion Cantos</a>, by
    Dan Simmons</u></strong>: 
    Some of my favorite SF novels ever.  The third book is the weakest,
    and the fourth book has problems, but I adore it.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u><a href="../../reviews/books/1-56389-470-X.html">Stardust</a>, by Neil
    Gaiman</u></strong>: 
    Really far too much Gaiman on this list.  But also a good book.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u><a href="../../reviews/books/0-380-78862-4.html">Cryptonomicon</a>, by Neal
    Stephenson</u></strong>: 
    Fantastic stuff.  Not SF in any traditional sense.  It's a combination
    of secret history and contemporary thriller.  But it's written in the
    Stephenson massive entertaining infodumping style, so it feels like SF
    and makes it onto lists like this.  It's very long, but I've read it
    twice and don't regret it.</li>
<li class="packed">World War Z, by Max Brooks: 
    Have a hard time believing this really belongs here, but I haven't
    read it so I couldn't say for sure.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u><a href="../../reviews/books/0-345-27505-5.html">The Last Unicorn</a>, by
    Peter S. Beagle</u></strong>: 
    Eh, it's not a bad book, but I'm not sure it really belongs on this
    list.  But it does have an aesthetic that's hard to find in any other
    book.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u><a href="../../reviews/books/0-380-70821-3.html">The Forever War</a>, by Joe
    Haldeman</u></strong>: 
    A very important response to the whole sub-genre of military SF, and
    very influential.</li>
<li class="packed"><u>Small Gods, by Terry Pratchett</u>: Getting to it.</li>
<li class="packed"><em><u>The Chronicles Of Thomas Covenant, The Unbeliever, by Stephen
    R. Donaldson</u></em>: 
    Read the first book, wasn't much of a fan.  I might get back to it at
    some point, but I'm not particularly eager.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><a href="../../reviews/books/0-671-87749-6a.html">The Vorkosigan Saga</a>, by
    Lois McMaster Bujold</strong>: 
    I don't like the early books as much as some, but I love some of the
    later books.  The last few have been disappointing, but overall very
    much worth reading, and belongs around here on the list.</li>
<li class="packed">Going Postal, by Terry Pratchett: Getting to it.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong>The Mote In God's Eye, by Larry Niven &amp; Jerry Pournelle</strong>: 
    Read many years ago and barely remember it.  I need to re-read it,
    particularly since there's a new sequal by Pournelle's daughter that
    looks well worth reading.</li>
<li class="packed"><em>The Sword Of Truth, by Terry Goodkind</em>: 
    I read way too many books in this series.  Others should not repeat my
    mistake.  Generic fantasy about incredibly stupid people that turns
    into libertarian political ravings.</li>
<li class="packed">The Road, by Cormac McCarthy: Not my thing.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><a href="../../reviews/books/1-58234-416-7.html">Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr
    Norrell</a>, by Susanna Clarke</strong>: 
    A nearly unique reading experience, and the best footnoted fantasy
    that I've ever read (and that includes Pratchett).  Great stuff if you
    don't mind the slow pace.  I'm eagerly hoping for an actual sequel.</li>
<li class="packed">I Am Legend, by Richard Matheson: 
    Having a hard time getting interested enough in a book about zombies.
    But I've been wrong about that
    <a href="../../reviews/books/0-316-12246-7.html">before</a>.</li>
<li class="packed">The Riftwar Saga, by Raymond E. Feist: 
    Heard of it, but not enough to get it onto my want list.</li>
<li class="packed">The Shannara Trilogy, by Terry Brooks: 
    Heard enough about it to not put it on my want list.</li>
<li class="packed">The Conan The Barbarian Series, by R.E. Howard: 
    Something that I feel like I "should" read, but usually I'm not a big
    fan of pulp.</li>
<li class="packed"><u>The Farseer Trilogy, by Robin Hobb</u>: 
    Own the first, which has been on my to-read list for a very long time.
    Someday I'll get to it.  I should probably buy all of the trilogy
    before starting it.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><a href="../../reviews/books/1-931561-64-8.html">The Time Traveler's
    Wife</a>, by Audrey Niffenegger</strong>: 
    Surprisingly good for a literary fantasy, with some fantastic moments
    of description.</li>
<li class="packed">The Way Of Kings, by Brandon Sanderson: Want to read at some point.</li>
<li class="packed">A Journey To The Center Of The Earth, by Jules Verne: 
    As above, uninspired to read Verne.</li>
<li class="packed"><em><a href="../../reviews/books/0-88038-905-2.html">The Legend Of Drizzt
    Series</a>, by R.A. Salvatore</em>: 
    Read the first one, and unless they get substantially better, I have
    no interest in reading more.  Very stock power fantasy with
    one-dimensional characters.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u><a href="../../reviews/books/0-765-31524-6.html">Old Man's War</a>, by John
    Scalzi</u></strong>: 
    The later books in the series are better than the first one.  An
    interesting take on military SF, but I'm not sure it really rises to
    the level of this sort of list.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u><a href="../../reviews/books/0-553-57331-4.html">The Diamond Age</a>, by
    Neil Stephenson</u></strong>: 
    One too many Stephenson for this list, plus <cite>Anathem</cite> is probably
    more deserving of this place, but there are some neat bits about
    computation theory.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u><a href="../../reviews/books/0-553-28789-3.html">Rendezvous With Rama</a>,
    by Arthur C. Clarke</u></strong>: 
    Completely overrated.  A bad book that just happens to be foundational
    in a particular sub-genre of SF.  Done much better by other people.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u><a href="../../reviews/books/0-765-34298-7.html">The Kushiel's Legacy
    Series</a>, by Jacqueline Carey</u></strong>: 
    By far my favorite epic fantasy series.  Lush, involved, very
    creative, and with a truly unusual heroine.  Wonderful stuff.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u><a href="../../reviews/books/0-06-105488-7.html">The Dispossessed</a>, by
    Ursula K. LeGuin</u></strong>: 
    Great, thoughtful SF.  Probably the best in the utopia genre, even
    though it isn't a utopia.</li>
<li class="packed">Something Wicked This Way Comes, by Ray Bradbury: Horror.  Eh.</li>
<li class="packed"><u>Wicked, by Gregory Maguire</u>: 
    On the list, but after a general Oz re-read.</li>
<li class="packed"><u>The Malazan Book Of The Fallen Series, by Steven Erikson</u>: 
    Own the first.  Completely intimidated by the length of the series.</li>
<li class="packed"><u>The Eyre Affair, by Jasper Fforde</u>: On the list.</li>
<li class="packed"><em><u><a href="../../reviews/books/1-85723-138-4.html">The Culture Series</a>, by
    Iain M. Banks</u></em>: 
    Brilliant stuff, highly recommended.  I only haven't read it all
    because I'm slowly digesting it.  Should be higher on the list than
    this.</li>
<li class="packed"><u>The Crystal Cave, by Mary Stewart</u>: On the list.</li>
<li class="packed"><u>Anathem, by Neal Stephenson</u>: On the list.</li>
<li class="packed">The Codex Alera Series, by Jim Butcher: 
    I'll read the Dresden series, or least part of it, first, and see if
    that inspires me to read more Butcher.  Dubious that this belongs on
    this list.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u><a href="../../reviews/books/0-671-45070-0.html">The Book Of The New
    Sun</a>, by Gene Wolfe</u></strong>: 
    Incredibly influential and important fantasy-flavored SF that should
    be much higher on the list than this.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u>The Thrawn Trilogy, by Timothy Zahn</u></strong>: 
    This is a <cite>Star Wars</cite> media tie-in series, and one of the few of
    that type that I've read.  I remember quite enjoying it a long time
    ago, and it's on the list to re-read at some point.</li>
<li class="packed">The Outlander Series, by Diana Gabaldan: 
    The only thing on this list that I've never even heard of.</li>
<li class="packed">The Elric Saga, by Michael Moorcock: 
    Definitely want to read this at some point, once I figure out the
    right place to start and probably after I've read some other
    Moorcock.</li>
<li class="packed">The Illustrated Man, by Ray Bradbury: 
    Waiting to see if I like the better-known Bradbury first.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u><a href="../../reviews/books/0-515-13881-9.html">Sunshine</a>, by Robin
    McKinley</u></strong>: 
    Quite possibly the best urban fantasy (in the modern definition) that
    I've ever read.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u><a href="../../reviews/books/0-812-51528-5.html">A Fire Upon The Deep</a>,
    by Vernor Vinge</u></strong>: 
    A little overrated, but it has a fun rendition of Usenet and some
    neat aliens.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong>The Caves Of Steel, by Isaac Asimov</strong>: 
    Read long ago.  Enjoyed it, but don't remember being grabbed by it.
    There's a bit too much Asimov on this list.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u><a href="../../reviews/books/0-553-56073-5.html">The Mars Trilogy</a>, by
    Kim Stanley Robinson</u></strong>: 
    The most detailed and in-depth politics that you'll find in SF, even
    more than Le Guin, at the cost of being mind-numbingly boring.  Very
    ambitious, but just doesn't move fast enough or have enough plot.
    Robinson is less a novelist than a political and hard science essayist
    in the form of a novel.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u>Lucifer's Hammer, by Larry Niven &amp; Jerry Pournelle</u></strong>: 
    Large-screen disaster novel with a heavy helping of libertarian
    utopian politics.  Does not belong anywhere near this list.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u><a href="../../reviews/books/0-553-56273-8.html">Doomsday Book</a>, by
    Connie Willis</u></strong>: 
    The best of Willis's time travel novels, with fewer communication
    failures and frantic faffing about than the other ones.  Borderline
    for this list, but probably deserves to be here.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u><a href="../../reviews/books/0-345-45940-7.html">Perdido Street Station</a>,
    by China Mieville</u></strong>: 
    Revolutionary fantasy.  The founding book of New Weird.  I think
    <a href="../../reviews/books/0-345-44438-8.html">The Scar</a> is a better
    book, but I can't argue with this being here.</li>
<li class="packed">The Xanth Series, by Piers Anthony: I've been warned off these.</li>
<li class="packed"><strong><u>The Space Trilogy, by C.S. Lewis</u></strong>: 
    I need to re-read this and write long reviews of them, since I have a
    lot to say about them.  But they need to be read in the context of the
    Christian faith to make any sense.</li>
