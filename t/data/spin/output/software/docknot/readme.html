<h2>BLURB</h2>

<p>
  DocKnot is a static web site generator built around a macro language
  called thread, with special support for managing software releases.  In
  addition to building a web site, it can generate distribution tarballs
  and consistent human-readable software package documentation from a YAML
  metadata file and templates.  The goal is to generate both web pages and
  distributed documentation files (such as README) from the same source,
  using templates for consistency across multiple packages.
</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
  In 1999, I wrote a program named spin that implemented an idiosyncratic
  macro language called thread.  It slowly expanded into a static web site
  generator and gained additional features to manage the journal entries,
  book reviews, RSS feeds, and software releases.  DocKnot is the latest
  incarnation.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to its static web site generator, DocKnot can use one
  metadata file as its source information and generate all the various
  bits of documentation for a software package.  This allows me to make
  any changes in one place and then regenerate the web page, included
  documentation, and other files to incorporate those changes.  It also
  lets me make changes to the templates to improve shared wording and push
  that out to every package I maintain without having to remember track
  those changes in each package.
</p>

<p>
  DocKnot is also slowly absorbing other tools that I use for software
  distribution and web site maintenance, such as generating distribution
  tarballs for software packages.
</p>

<p>
  DocKnot was designed and written for my personal needs, and I'm not sure
  it will be useful for anyone else.  At the least, the template files are
  rather specific to my preferences about how to write package
  documentation, and the thread macro language is highly specialized for
  my personal web site.  I'm not sure if I'll have the time to make it a
  more general tool.  But you're certainly welcome to use it if you find
  it useful, send pull requests to make it more general, or take ideas
  from it for your own purposes.
</p>

<h2>REQUIREMENTS</h2>

<p>
  Perl 5.24 or later and Module::Build are required to build this module.
  The following additional Perl modules are required to use it:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
    Date::Language (part of TimeDate)</li>
<li>
    Date::Parse (part of TimeDate)</li>
<li>
    File::BaseDir</li>
<li>
    File::ShareDir</li>
<li>
    Git::Repository</li>
<li>
    Image::Size</li>
<li>
    IO::Compress::Xz (part of IO-Compress-Lzma)</li>
<li>
    IO::Uncompress::Gunzip (part of IO-Compress)</li>
<li>
    IPC::Run</li>
<li>
    IPC::System::Simple</li>
<li>
    JSON::MaybeXS 1.004000 or later</li>
<li>
    Kwalify</li>
<li>
    List::SomeUtils 0.07 or later</li>
<li>
    Path::Iterator::Rule</li>
<li>
    Path::Tiny 0.101 or later</li>
<li>
    Perl6::Slurp</li>
<li>
    Pod::Thread 3.01 or later</li>
<li>
    Sort::Versions</li>
<li>
    Template (part of Template Toolkit)</li>
<li>
    YAML::XS 0.81 or later</li>
</ul>

<h2>BUILDING AND INSTALLATION</h2>

<p>
  DocKnot uses Module::Build and can be installed using the same process
  as any other Module::Build module:
</p>

<pre>    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build install</pre>

<p>
  You will have to run the last command as root unless you're installing
  into a local Perl module tree in your home directory.
</p>

<h2>TESTING</h2>

<p>
  DocKnot comes with a test suite, which you can run after building with:
</p>

<pre>    ./Build test</pre>

<p>
  If a test fails, you can run a single test with verbose output via:
</p>

<pre>    ./Build test --test_files &lt;path-to-test&gt;</pre>

<p>
  Capture::Tiny and File::Copy::Recursive are required to run the test
  suite.  The following additional Perl modules will be used by the test
  suite if present:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
    Devel::Cover</li>
<li>
    Perl::Critic::Freenode</li>
<li>
    Test::CPAN::Changes (part of CPAN-Changes)</li>
<li>
    Test::MinimumVersion</li>
<li>
    Test::Perl::Critic</li>
<li>
    Test::Pod</li>
<li>
    Test::Pod::Coverage</li>
<li>
    Test::Spelling</li>
<li>
    Test::Strict</li>
<li>
    Test::Synopsis</li>
</ul>

<p>
  All are available on CPAN.  Those tests will be skipped if the modules
  are not available.
</p>

<p>
  To enable tests that don't detect functionality problems but are used to
  sanity-check the release, set the environment variable RELEASE_TESTING
  to a true value.  To enable tests that may be sensitive to the local
  environment or that produce a lot of false positives without uncovering
  many problems, set the environment variable AUTHOR_TESTING to a true
  value.
</p>

<h2>SUPPORT</h2>

<p>
  The DocKnot web page at:

<p>
  Please be aware that I tend to be extremely busy and work projects often
  take priority.  I'll save your report and get to it as soon as I can,
  but it may take me a couple of months.
