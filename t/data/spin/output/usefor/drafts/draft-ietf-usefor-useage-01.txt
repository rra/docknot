This is a fake draft to test the \size function of spin.  I would include
the real draft but the Internet-Draft license is not necessarily free,
so a fake file like this is used instead to avoid any license issues.

This draft file is artificially longer to force the size calculation into
KB and thus test the shifting of orders of magnitude.
