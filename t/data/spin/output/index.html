<p>
It has been said that the web is a triumph of form over content.  The
Internet equivalent of television.  The medium designed for people with
five second attention spans.  Well, anything that can only hold my
attention for five seconds, I don't want to see in the first place.  I
like words.  I don't like pointless graphics.  I don't have a burning
desire to click on everything I see.  And so, these are my web pages.
</p>

<p>
An attempt to create a triumph of content over form, if you will.
</p>

<p>
Graphics are sparse.  Text is common.  Links are present only when they
add something to the content.  All pages are validated
<a href="notes/xhtml.html">XHTML</a>, as strict as possible, with all formatting
information in style sheets, so that they will be readable on any
standards-compliant browser.  And somewhere herein is, I hope, something
that will capture your attention for more than five seconds.
</p>

<p>
Welcome.
