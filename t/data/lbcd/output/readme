BLURB

  lbcd is a daemon that runs on a UNIX system and answers UDP queries with
  information about system load, number of logged-on users, uptime, and
  free /tmp space.  This information can be used to accumulate system
  status across a cluster with light-weight queries or can be used as
  input to a load-balancing system to choose the best system to which to
  direct new incoming connections.

DESCRIPTION

  The lbcd daemon runs on a UNIX system and answers UDP queries (by
  default on port 4330) with information about system load, number of
  logged on users, uptime, and free /tmp space.  This information can be
  used to accumulate system status across a cluster with light-weight
  queries or can be used as input to a load-balancing system to choose the
  best system to which to direct new incoming connections.  It was
  designed for use with the lbnamed DNS load balancer, available at:

      <http://www.stanford.edu/~riepel/lbnamed/>

  It was originally written by Roland Schemers, was rewritten by Larry
  Schwimmer to add protocol version 3 with some additional features and
  service probing, and is currently maintained by Russ Allbery.

  The information provided isn't particularly sophisticated, and a good
  hardware load balancer will be able to consider such things as
  connection latency and responsiveness to make better decisions, but lbcd
  with lbnamed works quite well for smaller scale problems, scales well to
  multiple load balance pools for different services, and is much simpler
  and cheaper to understand and deploy.

  Included in this package is a small client program, lbcdclient, which
  can query an lbcd server and display a formatted version of the returned
  information.

REQUIREMENTS

  lbcd is written in C, so you'll need a C compiler.  It also uses kernel
  calls to obtain load and uptime information, and at present has only
  been ported to Linux, Solaris, AIX, various BSD systems, Mac OS X,
  HP-UX, IRIX, and Tru64.  It is currently primarily tested on Linux.
  Platforms not listed may require some porting effort, as may old or
  unusual platforms that aren't regularly tested.

  The lbcdclient program requires Perl (any version should do).

  To bootstrap from a Git checkout, or if you change the Automake files
  and need to regenerate Makefile.in, you will need Automake 1.11 or
  later.  For bootstrap or if you change configure.ac or any of the m4
  files it includes and need to regenerate configure or config.h.in, you
  will need Autoconf 2.64 or later.

INSTALLATION

  You can build and install remctl with the standard commands:

      ./configure
      make
      make install

  Pass --enable-silent-rules to configure for a quieter build (similar to
  the Linux kernel).  Use make warnings instead of make to build with full
  GCC compiler warnings (requires a relatively current version of GCC).

  The last step will probably have to be done as root.  By default, remctl
  installs itself under /usr/local; you can change that path by passing
  the --prefix=PATH argument to configure.

  lbcd looks for $sysconfdir/nolbcd and returns the maximum load if that
  file is present, allowing one to effectively drop a system out of a
  load-balanced pool by touching that file.  By default, the path is
  /usr/local/etc/nolbcd, but you may want to pass --sysconfdir=/etc to
  configure to use /etc/nolbcd.

  lbcdclient is written in Perl, so you may have to edit the first line of
  the script to point to the correct Perl location on your system.  It
  does not use any sophisticated Perl features or add-on modules.

  You will generally want to start lbcd at system boot.  All that is
  needed is a simple init script to start lbcd with the appropriate
  options or kill it again.  It writes its PID into /var/run/lbcd.pid by
  default (and this can be changed with the -P option).  On many systems,
  lbcd will need to run as root or as a member of particular groups to
  obtain system load average and uptime information.

TESTING

  lbcd comes with a rudimentary test suite, which you can run after
  building lbcd with:

      make check

  If a test case fails, please run the that individual test case with
  verbose output using:

      tests/runtests -o <name-of-test>

  and send me the output when reporting the problem.  Currently, the test
  suite only checks the portability and utility libraries; tests for lbcd
  and lbcdclient are coming in later releases.
