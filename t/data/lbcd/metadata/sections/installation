You can build and install remctl with the standard commands:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

Pass --enable-silent-rules to configure for a quieter build (similar to
the Linux kernel).  Use make warnings instead of make to build with full
GCC compiler warnings (requires a relatively current version of GCC).

The last step will probably have to be done as root.  By default, remctl
installs itself under /usr/local; you can change that path by passing the
--prefix=PATH argument to configure.

lbcd looks for $sysconfdir/nolbcd and returns the maximum load if that
file is present, allowing one to effectively drop a system out of a
load-balanced pool by touching that file.  By default, the path is
/usr/local/etc/nolbcd, but you may want to pass --sysconfdir=/etc to
configure to use /etc/nolbcd.

lbcdclient is written in Perl, so you may have to edit the first line of
the script to point to the correct Perl location on your system.  It does
not use any sophisticated Perl features or add-on modules.

You will generally want to start lbcd at system boot.  All that is needed
is a simple init script to start lbcd with the appropriate options or kill
it again.  It writes its PID into /var/run/lbcd.pid by default (and this
can be changed with the -P option).  On many systems, lbcd will need to
run as root or as a member of particular groups to obtain system load
average and uptime information.
