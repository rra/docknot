lbcd is a daemon that runs on a UNIX system and answers UDP queries with
information about system load, number of logged-on users, uptime, and free
/tmp space.  This information can be used to accumulate system status
across a cluster with light-weight queries or can be used as input to a
load-balancing system to choose the best system to which to direct new
incoming connections.
