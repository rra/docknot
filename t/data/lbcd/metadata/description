The lbcd daemon runs on a UNIX system and answers UDP queries (by default
on port 4330) with information about system load, number of logged on
users, uptime, and free /tmp space.  This information can be used to
accumulate system status across a cluster with light-weight queries or can
be used as input to a load-balancing system to choose the best system to
which to direct new incoming connections.  It was designed for use with
the lbnamed DNS load balancer, available at:

    https://www.stanford.edu/~riepel/lbnamed/

It was originally written by Roland Schemers, was rewritten by Larry
Schwimmer to add protocol version 3 with some additional features and
service probing, and is currently maintained by Russ Allbery.

The information provided isn't particularly sophisticated, and a good
hardware load balancer will be able to consider such things as connection
latency and responsiveness to make better decisions, but lbcd with lbnamed
works quite well for smaller scale problems, scales well to multiple load
balance pools for different services, and is much simpler and cheaper to
understand and deploy.

Included in this package is a small client program, lbcdclient, which can
query an lbcd server and display a formatted version of the returned
information.
