lbcd looks for `$sysconfdir/nolbcd` and returns the maximum load if that
file is present, allowing one to effectively drop a system out of a
load-balanced pool by touching that file.  By default, the path is
`/usr/local/etc/nolbcd`, but you may want to pass `--sysconfdir=/etc` to
configure to use `/etc/nolbcd`.

lbcdclient is written in Perl, so you may have to edit the first line of
the script to point to the correct Perl location on your system.  It does
not use any sophisticated Perl features or add-on modules.
