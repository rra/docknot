lbcd comes with a rudimentary test suite, which you can run after building
lbcd with:

    make check

If a test case fails, please run the that individual test case with
verbose output using:

    tests/runtests -o <name-of-test>

and send me the output when reporting the problem.  Currently, the test
suite only checks the portability and utility libraries; tests for lbcd
and lbcdclient are coming in later releases.
