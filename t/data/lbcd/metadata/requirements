lbcd is written in C, so you'll need a C compiler.  It also uses kernel
calls to obtain load and uptime information, and at present has only been
ported to Linux, Solaris, AIX, various BSD systems, Mac OS X, HP-UX, IRIX,
and Tru64.  It is currently primarily tested on Linux.  Platforms not
listed may require some porting effort, as may old or unusual platforms
that aren't regularly tested.

The lbcdclient program requires Perl (any version should do).
