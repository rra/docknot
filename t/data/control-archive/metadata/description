This package contains three major components:

* All of the configuration used to generate a `control.ctl` file for INN
  and the `PGPKEYS` and `README.html` files distributed with pgpcontrol,
  along with the script to generate those files.

* Software to process control messages, verify them against that
  authorization information, and maintain a control message archive and
  list of active newsgroups.  Software is also included to generate
  reports of recent changes to the list of active newsgroups.

* The documentation files included in the control message archive and
  newsgroup lists on ftp.isc.org.

Manual changes to the canonical newsgroup list are supported in a way that
generates the same log messages and uses the same locking structure so
that they can co-exist with automated changes and be included in the same
reports.

This is the software that generates the [active newsgroup
lists](ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/usenet/CONFIG/) and [control message
archive](ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/usenet/control/) hosted on ftp.isc.org, and
the source of the `control.ctl` file provided with INN.
