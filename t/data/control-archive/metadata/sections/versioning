This package uses a three-part version number.  The first number will be
incremented for major changes, major new functionality, incompatible
changes to the configuration format (more than just adding new keys), or
similar disruptive changes.  For lesser changes, the second number will be
incremented for any change to the code or functioning of the software.  A
change to the third part of the version number indicates a release with
changes only to the configuration, PGP keys, and documentation files.
