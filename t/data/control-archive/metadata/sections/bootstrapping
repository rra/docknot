This package is intended to provide all of the tools, configuration, and
information required to duplicate the ftp.isc.org control message archive
and newsgroup list service if you so desire.  To set up a similar service
based on that service, however, you will also want to bootstrap from the
existing data.  Here is the procedure for that:

1. Be sure that you're starting from the latest software and set of
   configuration files.  I will generally try to make a new release after
   committing a batch of changes, but I may not make a new release after
   every change.  See the sections below for information about the Git
   repository in which this package is maintained.  You can always clone
   that repository to get the latest configuration (and then merge or
   cherry-pick changes from my repository into your repository as you
   desire).

2. Download the current newsgroup list from:

       ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/usenet/CONFIG/newsgroups.bz2

   and then bootstrap the database from it:

   ```sh
       bzip2 -dc newsgroups.bz2 | scripts/update-control bulkload
   ```

3. If you want the log information so that your reports will include
   changes made in the ftp.isc.org archive before you created your own,
   copy the contents of ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/usenet/CONFIG/LOGS/ into
   `/srv/control/logs`.

4. If you want to start with the existing control message repository,
   download the contents of ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/usenet/control/ into
   `/srv/control/archive`.  You can do this using a recursive download
   tool that understands FTP, such as wget, but please use the options
   that add delays and don't hammer the server to death.

After finishing those steps, you will have a copy of the ftp.isc.org
archive and can start processing control messages, possibly with different
configuration choices.  You can generate the files that are found in
ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/usenet/CONFIG/ by running `scripts/export-control`
as described above.
