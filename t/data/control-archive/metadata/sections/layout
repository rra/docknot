The configuration data is in one file per hierarchy in the `config`
directory.  Each file has the format specified in FORMAT and is designed
to be readable by INN's new configuration parser in case this can be
further automated down the road.  The `config/special` directory contains
overrides, raw `control.ctl` fragments that should be used for particular
hierarchies instead of automatically-generated entries (usually for
special comments).  Eventually, the format should be extended to handle as
many of these cases as possible.

The `keys` directory contains the PGP public keys for every hierarchy that
has one.  The user IDs on these keys must match the signer expected by the
configuration data for the corresponding hierarchy.

The `forms` directory contains the basic file structure for the three
generated files.

The `scripts` directory contains all the software that generates the
configuration and documentation files, processes control messages, updates
the database, creates the newsgroup lists, and generates reports.  Most
scripts in that directory have POD documentation included at the end of
the script, viewable by running perldoc on the script.

The `templates` directory contains templates for the `control-summary`
script.  These are the templates I use myself.  Other installations should
customize them.

The `docs` directory contains the extra documentation files that are
distributed from ftp.isc.org in the control message archive and newsgroup
list directories, plus the DocKnot metadata for this package.
