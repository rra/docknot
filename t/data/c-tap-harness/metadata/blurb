C TAP Harness is a pure-C implementation of TAP, the Test Anything
Protocol.  TAP is the text-based protocol used by Perl's test suite.  This
package provides a harness similar to Perl's Test::Harness for running
tests, with some additional features useful for test suites in packages
that use Autoconf and Automake, and C and shell libraries to make writing
TAP-compliant test programs easier.
