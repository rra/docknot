On particularly slow or loaded systems, you may see intermittant failures
from the `server/streaming` test because it's timing-sensitive.

The test suite will also need to be able to bind to 127.0.0.1 on port
11119 and 14373 to run test network server programs.

To test anonymous authentication, the KDC configured in the test suite
needs to support service tickets for the anonymous identity (not a
standard configuration).  This test will be skipped if the KDC does not
support this.

To test user handling in remctld, you will need the `fakeroot` command
(available in the `fakeroot` package in Debian and Ubuntu).  This test
will be skipped if `fakeroot` isn't available.

The following additional Perl modules will be used by the test suite for
the main package and the Perl bindings if installed:

* Test::MinimumVersion
* Test::Perl::Critic
* Test::Pod
* Test::Spelling
* Test::Strict
* Test::Synopsis

All are available on CPAN.  Those tests will be skipped if the modules are
not available.
