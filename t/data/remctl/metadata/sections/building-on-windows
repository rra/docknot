First, install the Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows Vista if you have not
already.  This is a free download from Microsoft for users of "Genuine
Microsoft Windows."  The `vcvars32.bat` environment provided by Visual
Studio may work as an alternative, but has not been tested.

Next, install the [MIT Kerberos for Windows
SDK](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/dist/index.html).  remctl has been
tested with version 3.2.1 but should hopefully work with later versions.

Then, follow these steps:

1. Run the `InitEnv.cmd` script included with the Windows SDK with
   parameters `"/xp /release"`.

2. Run the `configure.bat` script, giving it as an argument the location
   of the Kerberos for Windows SDK.  For example, if you installed the KfW
   SDK in `"c:\KfW SDK"`, you should run:

   ```
       configure "c:\KfW SDK"
   ```

3. Run `nmake` to start compiling.  You can ignore the warnings.

If all goes well, you will have `remctl.exe` and `remctl.dll`.  The latter
is a shared library used by the client program.  It exports the same
interface as the UNIX libremctl library.
