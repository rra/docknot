DESCRIPTION

[% indent(to_text(description), 2) %]

REQUIREMENTS

[% indent(to_text(requirements), 2) %]
[% IF build.lancaster %]
  To enable tests that don't detect functionality problems but are used to
  sanity-check the release, set the environment variable RELEASE_TESTING
  to a true value.  To enable tests that may be sensitive to the local
  environment or that produce a lot of false positives without uncovering
  many problems, set the environment variable AUTHOR_TESTING to a true
  value.
[% END %][% IF build.autotools %]

  To bootstrap from a Git checkout, or if you change the Automake files
  and need to regenerate Makefile.in, you will need Automake
  [% build.automake %] or later.  For bootstrap or if you change
  configure.ac or any of the m4 files it includes and need to regenerate
  configure or config.h.in, you will need Autoconf [% build.autoconf %] or
  later.[% IF build.manpages %]  Perl is also required to generate manual
  pages from a fresh Git checkout.[% END %][% IF bootstrap %]
  [% indent(to_text(bootstrap), 2) %][% END %]
[% END %][% IF build.type == 'Module::Build' %]
BUILDING AND INSTALLATION

  [% name %] uses Module::Build and can be installed using the same process
  as any other Module::Build module:

      perl Build.PL
      ./Build
      ./Build test
      ./Build install

  You will have to run the last command as root unless you're installing
  into a local Perl module tree in your home directory.
[% ELSIF build.type == 'ExtUtils::MakeMaker' %]
BUILDING AND INSTALLATION

  [% name %] uses ExtUtils::MakeMaker and can be installed using the same
  process as any other ExtUtils::MakeMaker module:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

  You'll probably need to do the last as root unless you're installing
  into a local Perl module tree in your home directory.

SOURCE REPOSITORY

  [% name %] is maintained using [% vcs.type %].  You can access the
  current source [% IF vcs.github %]on GitHub at:

      https://github.com/[% vcs.github %]

  or [% END %]by cloning the repository at:

      [% vcs.url %]

  or view the repository via the web at:

      [% vcs.browse %]
[% IF vcs.github %]
  The eyrie.org repository is the canonical one, maintained by the author,
  but using GitHub is probably more convenient for most purposes.  Pull
  requests are gratefully reviewed and normally accepted.
  [% IF support.cpan %]It's probably better to use the CPAN bug tracker
  than GitHub issues, though, to keep all Perl module issues in the same
  place.[% END %]
[% ELSIF vcs.type == 'Git' %]
  When contributing modifications, patches (possibly generated by
  git-format-patch) are preferred to Git pull requests.
