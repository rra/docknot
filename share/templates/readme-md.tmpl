## Description

[% description %]

## Requirements

[% requirements %]
[% IF build.autotools %]
To bootstrap from a Git checkout, or if you change the Automake files
and need to regenerate Makefile.in, you will need Automake
[% build.automake %] or later.  For bootstrap or if you change
configure.ac or any of the m4 files it includes and need to regenerate
configure or config.h.in, you will need Autoconf [% build.autoconf %] or
later.[% IF build.manpages %]  Perl is also required to generate manual
pages from a fresh Git checkout.[% END %][% IF bootstrap %]
[% bootstrap %][% END %]
[% END %][% IF build.type == 'Module::Build' %]
## Building and Installation

[% name %] uses Module::Build and can be installed using the same process
as any other Module::Build module:

```
    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install
```

You will have to run the last command as root unless you're installing
into a local Perl module tree in your home directory.
[% IF build.lancaster %]
To enable tests that don't detect functionality problems but are used to
sanity-check the release, set the environment variable `RELEASE_TESTING`
to a true value.  To enable tests that may be sensitive to the local
environment or that produce a lot of false positives without uncovering
many problems, set the environment variable `AUTHOR_TESTING` to a true
value.
[% END %][% ELSIF build.type == 'ExtUtils::MakeMaker' %]
## Building and Installation

[% name %] uses ExtUtils::MakeMaker and can be installed using the same
process as any other ExtUtils::MakeMaker module:

```
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
```

You'll probably need to do the last as root unless you're installing
into a local Perl module tree in your home directory.
[% IF build.lancaster %]
To enable tests that don't detect functionality problems but are used to
sanity-check the release, set the environment variable `RELEASE_TESTING`
to a true value.  To enable tests that may be sensitive to the local
environment or that produce a lot of false positives without uncovering
many problems, set the environment variable `AUTHOR_TESTING` to a true
value.
[% END %][% ELSIF build.type == 'Autoconf' %][% IF build.install %]
## Building and Installation

You can build and install [% name %] with the standard commands:

```
    ./configure
    make
    make install
```
[% ELSE %]
## Building

You can build [% name %] with the standard commands:

```
    ./configure
    make
```
[% END %]
If you are building from a Git clone, first run `./bootstrap` in the
source directory to generate the build files.[% IF build.install %]
`make install` will probably have to be done as root.[% END %]  Building
outside of the source directory is also supported, if you wish, by
creating an empty directory and then running configure with the correct
relative path.
[% IF build.middle %]
[% build.middle %]
[% END %][% IF build.kerberos %]
Normally, configure will use `krb5-config` to determine the flags to use
to compile with your Kerberos libraries.  To specify a particular
`krb5-config` script to use, either set the `PATH_KRB5_CONFIG` environment
variable or pass it to configure like:

```
    ./configure PATH_KRB5_CONFIG=/path/to/krb5-config
```

If `krb5-config` isn't found, configure will look for the standard
Kerberos libraries in locations already searched by your compiler.  If the
the `krb5-config` script first in your path is not the one corresponding
to the Kerberos libraries you want to use, or if your Kerberos libraries
and includes aren't in a location searched by default by your compiler,
you need to specify a different Kerberos installation root via
`--with-krb5=PATH`.  For example:

```
    ./configure --with-krb5=/usr/pubsw
```

You can also individually set the paths to the include directory and the
library directory with `--with-krb5-include` and `--with-krb5-lib`.  You
may need to do this if Autoconf can't figure out whether to use lib,
lib32, or lib64 on your platform.

To not use krb5-config and force library probing even if there is a
krb5-config script on your path, set PATH_KRB5_CONFIG to a nonexistent
path:

```
    ./configure PATH_KRB5_CONFIG=/nonexistent
```

`krb5-config` is not used and library probing is always done if either
`--with-krb5-include` or `--with-krb5-lib` are given.
[% IF build.gssapi %]
GSS-API libraries are found the same way: with `krb5-config` by default if
it is found, and a `--with-gssapi=PATH` flag to specify the installation
root.  `PATH_KRB5_CONFIG` is similarly used to find `krb5-config` for the
GSS-API libraries, and `--with-gssapi-include` and `--with-gssapi-lib` can
be used to specify the exact paths, overriding any `krb5-config` results.
[% END %][% END %]
Pass `--enable-silent-rules` to configure for a quieter build (similar to
the Linux kernel).  Use `make warnings` instead of `make` to build with
full GCC compiler warnings (requires either GCC or Clang and may require a
relatively current version of the compiler).
[% IF build.reduced_depends %]
You can pass the `--enable-reduced-depends` flag to configure to try to
minimize the shared library dependencies encoded in the binaries.  This
omits from the link line all the libraries included solely because other
libraries depend on them and instead links the programs only against
libraries whose APIs are called directly.  This will only work with shared
libraries and will only work on platforms where shared libraries properly
encode their own dependencies (this includes most modern platforms such as
all Linux).  It is intended primarily for building packages for Linux
distributions to avoid encoding unnecessary shared library dependencies
that make shared library migrations more difficult.  If none of the above
made any sense to you, don't bother with this flag.

[% END %][% IF !readme.testing %]
## Testing
[% IF test.prefix %]
[% test.prefix %]
[% ELSE %]
[% name %] comes with a test suite, which you can run after building with:
[% END %]
```
    make check
```

If a test fails, you can run a single test with verbose output via:

```
    tests/runtests -o <name-of-test>
```

Do this instead of running the test program directly since it will ensure
that necessary environment variables are set up.
[% IF test.suffix %]
[% test.suffix %]
[% END %][% IF build.lancaster %]
To enable tests that don't detect functionality problems but are used to
sanity-check the release, set the environment variable `RELEASE_TESTING`
to a true value.  To enable tests that may be sensitive to the local
environment or that produce a lot of false positives without uncovering
many problems, set the environment variable `AUTHOR_TESTING` to a true
value.

## Source Repository

[% name %] is maintained using [% vcs.type %].  You can access the current
source [% IF vcs.github %]on [GitHub](https://github.com/[% vcs.github %])
or [% END %]by cloning the repository at:

[% vcs.url %]

or [view the repository on the web]([% vcs.browse %]).
[% IF vcs.github %]
The eyrie.org repository is the canonical one, maintained by the
author, but using GitHub is probably more convenient for most purposes.
Pull requests are gratefully reviewed and normally accepted.
[% IF support.cpan %]It's probably better to use the CPAN bug tracker than
GitHub issues, though, to keep all Perl module issues in the same
place.[% END %]
[% ELSIF vcs.type == 'Git' %]
When contributing modifications, patches (possibly generated by
git-format-patch) are preferred to Git pull requests.
