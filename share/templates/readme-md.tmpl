## Requirements

[% requirements %]
[% IF requirements.lancaster %]
To enable tests that don't detect functionality problems but are used to
sanity-check the release, set the environment variable RELEASE_TESTING
to a true value.  To enable tests that may be sensitive to the local
environment or that produce a lot of false positives without uncovering
many problems, set the environment variable AUTHOR_TESTING to a true
value.
[% END %][% IF build.autotools %]
To bootstrap from a Git checkout, or if you change the Automake files
and need to regenerate Makefile.in, you will need Automake
[% build.automake %] or later.  For bootstrap or if you change
configure.ac or any of the m4 files it includes and need to regenerate
configure or config.h.in, you will need Autoconf [% build.autoconf %] or
later.
[% END %]

[% END %]## Support

The [[% name %] web page]([% support.web %]) will always have the current
version of this package, the current documentation, and pointers to any
additional resources.
[% IF support.cpan %]
For bug tracking, this package uses the [CPAN bug
tracker](https://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Name=[% support.cpan %])
[% END %][% IF support.listname %]
New [% name %] releases are announced on the [% support.listname %]
mailing list.  To subscribe or see the list archives, go to the
[[% support.listname %] management page]([% support.listurl %]).
[% END %]

I welcome bug reports and patches for this package at
[% support.email %][% IF support.cpan %] or via the CPAN bug
tracker[% END %].  However, please be aware that I tend to be extremely
busy and work projects often take priority.  I'll save your mail and get
to it as soon as I can, but it may take me a couple of months.

## Source Repository

[% name %] is maintained using [% vcs.type %].  You can access the current
source [% IF vcs.github %]on [GitHub](https://github.com/[% vcs.github %])
or [% END %]by cloning the repository at:

[% vcs.url %]

or [view the repository on the web]([% vcs.browse %]).
[% IF vcs.github %]
The eyrie.org repository is the canonical one, maintained by the
author, but using GitHub is probably more convenient for most purposes.
Pull requests are gratefully reviewed and normally accepted.
[% IF support.cpan %]It's probably better to use the CPAN bug tracker than
GitHub issues, though, to keep all Perl module issues in the same
place.[% END %]
[% ELSIF vcs.type == 'Git' %]
When contributing modifications, patches (possibly generated by
git-format-patch) are preferred to Git pull requests.
